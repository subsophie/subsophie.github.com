You step out of the taxi and pay the driver with the last few bills you have to your name.  This job couldn&#39;t have come at a better time. You do a quick double check to make sure you have all of your papers.  The interviewer insisted that all forms of ID were required on your first day, including your social security card, birth certificate, passport ... everything.  It was also requested that you bring a health department verified drug test and a physical report with a clean bill of health.  A deep breath fills your lungs. You feel more organized and together than you&#39;ve ever been in your life.

The claustrophobic revolving door opens up into the expansive lobby.  The morning sun shines through the front window causing the M&amp;R logo to be silhouetted on the floor at your feet.  The hair on the back of your neck stands up.  A premonition perhaps?  If so... then a premonition of what?

At the far end of the lobby is a reception booth.  A cute secretary is sitting behind the desk talking on the phone.  This place is really bustling.  A herd of well-dressed businessmen brush past you and into an elevator alcove.  You&#39;re beginning to get excited.  This job could really be a door opener for you.

The secretary looks up at you while talking on the phone and gives the universal hand gesture indicating she&#39;ll be right with you.  You use the opportunity to ogle her obvious attributes.

She is insanely cute, emphasized even more by the &quot;office tease&quot; outfit she&#39;s bursting out of.  Her white blouse is tight, stretched across breasts that are either fake or a divine gift. The shirt is buttoned (or rather unbuttoned) low enough to display an ample eyeful of cleavage and a hint of a lacy, red bra.   The thread sticking out from where her top button used to be catches your attention as you devour her chest with your eyes.

&lt;i&gt;She must have lost the button.  She probably breathed in and shot the thing across the room.&lt;/i&gt;

The thought makes you smile. It feels good to smile and it helps to alleviate some of the nervousness that is pulsing through your entire body.  You look up from the wonderful view to see that she&#39;s smiling back at you.  You feel the blush on your face.

&quot;Hi.  My name is Nikki.  How may I make your day better?&quot; Her voice is musical, the words a sing-song tease.  A hundred sexy images flood through your head making your blush grow deeper.


[[Tell her that you&#39;re here for the data entry position.|lobby_checkedin]]
[[Ask her if she&#39;d like to go out and get a drink later.|lobby_getadrink]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="lobby_checkedin" tags="" position="975,100">&quot;I&#39;m &lt;&lt;print $name_first&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;print $name_last&gt;&gt;.  I&#39;m supposed to check in this morning.&quot;

&quot;Oh you&#39;re the new secre...&quot;

She giggles.

&quot;I mean, data entry worker.  Let me get the paperwork.&quot;

She stands up and you see her short, black skirt that flares out into a pleated bottom that hits her mid-thigh.  When she leans over to get papers out of the filing cabinet, you catch the briefest glimpse of a garter clasp and the smooth, creamy flesh above her stocking.

You feel the stir down below and bite your lip as a tent in your pants pops up.  You press up against the desk hoping no one will notice.

&lt;i&gt;What if someone DOES notice?  What if she notices?&lt;/i&gt;

This is not the way you want your first day at work to be remembered.  You try and concentrate on mundane elements of the desk:  The marble top,  the blinking phone,  the M&amp;R stationary stacked for guest use.  The embarrassing protrusion begins to diminish and you allow yourself to let out the breath you were holding.

&quot;Here you go, sweetie.&quot;

She plops a large stack of papers in front of you and your eyes dart down to look at them, catching sight of her wonderful cleavage again.  The embarrassing protrusion returns in full and you bite your lip, pressing tighter to the desk to hide it.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; you stammer.  You drag your eyes up to hers and find she&#39;s staring at you intently as if trying to tell you something with just her eyes.  Has she seen your problem?

Her eyes dart back and forth across the room and then without warning she leans forward across the desk to get closer to you.  Her arms on the desk make her cleavage bulge and you fight back a whimper as your eyes find them again.

&quot;Read it carefully,&quot; she says.  Her voice is soft, her breath sweet and warm.  Your mouth waters with desire and lust.  Does this girl know what she&#39;s doing?  Does she realize how erotic she makes each and every word?

&quot;I will.&quot;  The words barely make it out of your throat.  All you can focus on is the memory of that glimpse of thigh.  The feast of cleavage in front of your face.  The smell of her breath, still lingering from her words.  You clear your throat and try again.

&quot;Thanks.  I always read everything carefully.&quot;  You smile at her, pleased that you&#39;ve managed to sound a little more in control.  Your brain races trying to figure out how to get over to one of the chairs without her noticing your embarrassing &#39;problem&#39;.

&quot;Would you please let them know that I&#39;m here.&quot;  You smile again.  That sounded very confident and self-assured.  The disappointment in her eyes catches you by surprise, but at least she turns her attention to the phone.  You quickly pick up the clipboard full of papers. Holding them in front of your crotch you hurry to one of the chairs and sit.   Your face is on fire.  Did anyone notice?  You look around and breathe a sigh of relief that no one seems to be interested in you at all.  Your eyes find the secretary.  She&#39;s talking into the phone again, giving you no attention.  It&#39;s only as she hangs up the phone that she finally gazes over at you and smiles.  The smile doesn&#39;t help the problem beneath the clipboard.

She breathes in and your eyes dart down to her breasts again. It takes all your will power to look back up to her eyes and finish stammering out your question.

&quot;Would you like to, uh...maybe go out later and you know, have a drink or something?&quot;

The words are no more past your lips when the regret kicks in.  This woman is WAY out of your league. Your face is burning.  It must be as red as the bra peeking up out of her blouse.

The grin that lights up her face sends your heart soaring.

&quot;Oh,&quot; she says, &quot;That&#39;s sweet.&quot;

For a moment, it seems like you might actually have a chance with this woman.  The moment passes.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to be tied up this evening,&quot; she says. Her eyes show regret.

She looks at you with curiosity.  No doubt she wants to know if you have anything better to do than ogle her chest and pester her for a date.  You clear your throat.


[[Tell her that you&#39;re here for the data entry position.|lobby_checkedin]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="lobby_questionnikki" tags="" position="1225,100">&quot;Do you like working here?&quot; you ask the girl as she hangs up the phone.  She looks over at you with an odd expression that is almost impossible to read.  Your heart jumps when it occurs to you that the look could indicate that she&#39;s seen the raging hard-on she&#39;s caused.  For a brief moment, you think you see a glimmer of fear and then it&#39;s gone in a mask of smiles.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m here all the time.  You spend so much time in the &#39;Pool&#39; that it starts to feel like home.&quot;

The pool?  You&#39;re about to ask her more, but the phone rings and she quickly snatches it up, giving you an apologetic smile.

&quot;Thank you for calling the M&amp;R Corporation.  How may I make your day better,&quot; she says in that teasing sing-song.  Your imagination goes wild and you quickly turn your attention back to the contract that covers the pulsing lump that the tease at the desk causes with her every action.


[[Read the Contract.|lobby_readcontract][$score_dom += 1]]
[[Sign the contract.|lobby_signcontract][$score_sub += 1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="lobby_readcontract" tags="" position="100,225">You skim through half of the first page before your eyes begin to cross.  This thing is written like stereo instructions.  Scandinavian stereo instructions. Your eyes drift back over to the girl behind the desk.  She&#39;s twirling the phone cord on her finger, biting at her lower lip as she replies to the speaking on the other end of the phone.  Her lips are flawless, shiny and inviting.

An involuntary throb down below makes you shake off the distraction and you return to the contract.  A deep breath and then you dive back in.  You start over from the top of the first page, determined to at least get the gist of what you&#39;re about to sign.  Page one comes and goes and you realize you still have no idea what you just read.

You glance at Nikki.

Throb.

You try the second page.

&quot;All employees of a sub-standard level will at all times be adorned in such attire as befits a company of this repute.  Penalty and Fees may apply if attire is not clean, crisp and appropriate.&quot;

&lt;i&gt;It can&#39;t be that strict.  Look at how SHE&#39;S dressed.  That can&#39;t possibly be appropriate.  Look at her...&lt;/i&gt;

You look.

Throb.

You flip through the contract, gaping at the forty seven pages of rules and terms of agreement.

You flip back to page one and stare at it for a moment.  The ambient music of the lobby fills your ears.  It&#39;s pleasant, almost hypnotic, elevator music and again you try to shake off the distraction and focus on the pages in front of your eyes.

Throb.

Forty seven pages.  How are you supposed to read through forty seven pages of this drivel.


[[This is too many rules for you. Pass on the job!|lobby_pass][$score_dom += 1]]

    &lt;&lt;set $contract = true&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;
You flip to the last page of the contract and find the expected blank line for your signature.  With a flourish you put your name on it.  You stare at the words on the back page for another two or three minutes, giving the tent in your pants the opportunity to diminish. Nikki smiles as you hand her the contract, but the smile has a trace of sadness in it that seems out of place.

She covers the mouthpiece of the phone with one hand and whispers, &quot;Welcome to the team.  I called Miss Payne and told her you were here.  She&#39;s supposed to meet you at the elevators.  I&#39;d hurry if I were you.  She REALLY doesn&#39;t like to be kept waiting.&quot;

You mumble a thank you to Nikki and turn to go.

&quot;Good luck on your first day, cutie,&quot; she says, still in that hushed whisper.  You turn to make your way to the elevator when you hear her mutter three more soft words.  &quot;You&#39;ll need it.&quot;


[[Go and meet Miss Payne.|payne_start][$image_name = &#39;payne&#39;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="lobby_pass" tags="" position="350,225">&lt;i&gt;Too many rules.&lt;/i&gt;

The thought drifts through your head as you stare at the thick stack of pages on the clipboard.  You look up at the busty tease behind the desk with regret.  Working with her would have been a wonderfully erotic adventure.  If nothing else, just seeing her behind the desk each day would have been masturbation material for months.  Despite the lump underneath the clipboard, however, your primary brain knows that this is never going to work out.  You let your arousal die down and then stand up and give the girl an apologetic smile.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong sweetie?&quot; the secretary says.  She covers the phone with one hand, her eyes big pools a man could drown in.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m right for this job.  I think I&#39;m gonna pass.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

The expression on her face turns grim.  The smile is gone.  The flirty sing-song removed from her voice.  Her eyes grow wide and there is no mistaking the emotion they convey.  The girl is scared.

&quot;...but I already called Miss Payne and told her you were here.  She&#39;s probably waiting for you at the elevators already.&quot;

She leans across the desk to you, the phone call that her hand covers forgotten in her anxiety.

&quot;Please go talk to her.  She hates to have her time wasted and I&#39;ll be in trouble for calling her down.  Will you go talk to her?  Please?&quot;

You would laugh if you weren&#39;t afraid of offending her.  The girl is almost in tears.  Over something as silly as this...

You&#39;re starting to feel better and better about turning down this job.  If a simple misunderstanding like this causes such anxiety, you&#39;d hate to see something serious go wrong.  These people seem way too intense for you.

Even still, no reason to get Nikki in trouble.  You&#39;ll just apologize and be on your way!

Her outfit and demeanor are a striking contrast to the secretary you were dealing with only moments before.  Her suit screams efficiency.  The skirt dropping down onto her thigh, emphasizing the thin heeled designer boots.  Her hair is pulled back.  Her makeup understated and no nonsense.  She is by no means unattractive, but you&#39;d never approach this woman in a social setting for fear of losing some vital body part in the process.

&quot;Who the hell are you?&quot; she barks.

You hold out your hand and she glances down with disdain at the outstretched appendage.

&quot;I&#39;m &lt;&lt;print $name_first&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;print $name_last&gt;&gt;.  I&#39;m supposed to start work today.&quot;

She stares at your hand until you put it down.  Her eyes meet yours and you can only look into them for a second before you find yourself looking away uncomfortably.

&quot;Well...you&#39;re not what I expected.  You hardly look like office girl material.&quot; she growls.

You laugh.  The sound that comes from you is not a comfortable sound.  Even to your own ears it sounds strained and anxious.  Your chuckle cuts off when you realize she&#39;s not laughing with you.  You start to speak but she cuts you off with a wave of her hand and just stares at you.  Time passes slowly as she eyeballs you up and down. You get the distinct impression that she&#39;s evaluating you.  You smile and wait, feeling horribly uncomfortable.  You don&#39;t know exactly where to put your hands and end up crossing them tightly to your chest in what you know is a defensive stance.  This woman makes you nervous.  Her eyes devour every inch of you and then a smile touches the corner of her mouth.  It is not a pleasant looking smile.

&quot;Where&#39;s your contract?&quot; she demands.  Before you can answer, she spies it in your hand and rips it away from you.

She pulls from her belt a long chain that has a key card connected to the end of it.  She swipes the card in a slot by the elevator and almost immediately the bell dings and the doors open.

She ushers you inside and then swipes the card again on a similar slot under the floor buttons.  She presses the &quot;9&quot; button and the car instantly starts to rocket upward.  Apparently the elevators require a key card to work.  Excitement causes those stomach butterflies to flutter.


[[Click here to continue.|hallway]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="bad_payne" tags="" position="725,225">&quot;What th&#39; hell is this?&quot; she growls.  She is staring at the blank line where your signature should be.  You don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re handling this very well.

&quot;I...um...I&#39;ve had second thoughts...&quot; you stammer.

&quot;You arrogant like snot,&quot; she snarls, &quot;We hire you, despite the fact that you&#39;re nowhere NEAR qualified.  I stop everything I&#39;m doing to come down and get you situated and you wait until NOW to tell me you&#39;ve CHANGED YOUR MIND!?!&quot;

When she puts it that way, it does sound kind of bad.

&quot;You have less than three seconds to scribble your name on this contract.&quot;  She tosses the thing back to you so hard that it hits your face before you have a chance to react.  A slight pain flares through your nose and you&#39;re amazed that it doesn&#39;t start bleeding.

&quot;We had a verbal agreement, you little bitch,&quot; she snarls at you, &quot;You agreed to train with us for two weeks.  You back out now and I&#39;ll take your skinny little ass to court.  Go on and try me.&quot;

    &lt;&lt;set $contract = true&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;
Feeling guilty and more than a little ashamed, you scribble your name on the contract.

&quot;You&#39;re going to be a pain in the ass, arent you?&quot;  Miss Payne asks as she swipes her key card for the elevator.  Apparently you can&#39;t access the machine without a card.  You scramble into the elevator behind her, while she swipes the card again and pushes the &quot;9&quot; button.

&quot;One more word out of you,&quot; Miss Payne growls, &quot;And you&#39;ll walk funny for a week!&quot;

The elevator begins to rocket upward and your training officially begins.

&quot;You sorry sack of shit!&quot;

It comes out as a low, guttural growl.

Her hand grabs your face, squeezing your cheeks together until your lips make a puckered &quot;O&quot; shape!  She pushes you against the wall with a strength that both surprises and alarms you.

&quot;I stopped what I was doing to come greet you, you little bitch!&quot;  she whispers in your ear, &quot;I knew you were going to be trouble the moment I saw you!  I just knew it!&quot;

You&#39;re probably imagining it, but it actually feels like she&#39;s about to lift you up off the floor with one arm.  The woman is insanely strong!

&quot;Now are you going to sign this contract, like a good little wussy girl?  Or are you going to mouth off to me again?&quot;

    &lt;&lt;set $contract = true&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;
As always when faced with this kind of confrontation, tears begin to pool up in your eyes.  You grab for the contract while she holds you pinned to the wall, and somehow you manage to scribble your name in the appropriate place.

&quot;See?&quot; she asks, &quot;Was that worth all the trouble?&quot;

She releases her death grip of your face and swipes her key card in the elevator.  You don&#39;t see any buttons so you can only assume that they are card activated.  The doors open and she smacks you hard on the ass, causing you to jump into the elevator.  She enters right behind you and swipes the card again, this time on the inside.  She presses nine and the elevator begins to move.

&quot;Wipe your eyes, crybaby,&quot; the horrible woman says.

You rub your hand across your face, clearing off your tears of anger.

&quot;You give me any more trouble today.&quot; she says, &quot;And I&#39;ll give you something to cry about!&quot;

&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;
You push with all your might against her arm and manage to push her away!  While she&#39;s regaining her balance you turn to escape the alcove, at least to get back out into the lobby where there are witnesses.

Then there&#39;s an arm around your neck, pulling you back.  With your air supply gone, you crumple to your knees.  Her weight causes the ground to race up toward your face and before you know it, your cheek is rubbing roughly against the carpet.  Suddenly, the horrible woman is on your back, twisting one of your arms painfully behind your back.  She shoves the contract under your nose and puts a pen in your one free hand.  You try to struggle to get up but she seems to have no trouble keeping you pinned and even has a free hand that she uses to help you scribble a mark on the signature line of the contract.

&quot;You are one troublesome little bitch,&quot; she grunts, dragging you to your feet.  She swipes a card across a slot which seems to summon the elevator and then shoves you inside the car that arrives.  You bounce hard off the wall inside and sink to your knees.  She slides her card again, this time on the inside, presses nine and then turns to you as the doors shut.

&quot;Welcome to M and R, bitch!  How ya&#39; like it so far?&quot; Her words scare you almost as much as the slap she gives you across the face.


[[Click here to continue.|hallway][$score_sub += 1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="hallway" tags="" position="100,350">The elevator door opens and Miss Payne steps out.

&quot;First door on the left,&quot; she barks, &quot;I&#39;ll be there in a minute. There&#39;s something I have to take care of first.&quot; She disappears down the hallway.

Out of curiosity, you try pushing the lobby button in the elevator, but nothing happens.  It takes a key card to change floors. A keycard you don&#39;t have!

With no other choice, you step out of the elevator and make your way to the first door on the left. 

You start to turn the knob, when a piercing scream erupts from the door across the hall.


[[It sounds like someone&#39;s in trouble. You&#39;d better check it out!|spanking1][$score_dom += 1, $image_name = &#39;katie&#39;]]

For a moment you stand there stunned, your brain unable to comprehend the scene in front of you.

You&#39;re standing in an elegant office, the modern furniture giving it an air of superiority.

What causes your brain to shut down for a moment is the half naked girl, kneeling on top of the desk. She is dressed in a white blouse and black skirt, equally as provocative as the receptionist downstairs.  &#39;Dressed&#39; isn&#39;t quite the right word for her state though.

Her blouse is unbuttoned, revealing a sexy push up bra and her skirt has been pushed up onto her back far enough to reveal the bright red panties stretched across a beautifully shaped backside.

This sight alone causes your jaw to drop. The real surprise is the man standing behind the desk, towering over the crying woman. His hand is paused in the air, his attention diverted from his task.  He is staring at you, his eyes burning with anger. Your eyes go from his hand, to the woman&#39;s behind and you notice it is beet red from the horrific spanking you interrupted. She is looking at you too, tears running down her face.

&quot;WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY OFFICE!?!&quot; the man roars. He moves around the desk towards you. You&#39;re beginning to think you might have made a mistake coming in here.  Compared to you, this brute is a giant!

&quot;Who is your supervisor?&quot; he demands, looming his height and bulk over you. You crane your neck to look up at his face. Before you have a chance to answer, a voice booms from behind you.

&quot;I am!&quot; Miss Payne storms in and breaks between you and the hulking brute. You breathe a sigh of relief. She&#39;ll sort this out and hopefully fire the asshole. Your eyes stray over to the poor girl on the desk. She still hasn&#39;t moved. She hasn&#39;t even covered herself up.  All she does is look at you with an expression of pity and sadness.  You feel much better about barging in and saving her.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for the interruption, Mr. Johnson,&quot; Miss Payne says, &quot;I&#39;m afraid this is a new secretary who doesn&#39;t know the rules yet.&quot; You can&#39;t believe your ears. She is actually apologizing to this man...about YOU! He looks at you for a moment, one eye squinting in appraisal. His lip turned up in a smirk.

&quot;I expect to see this &#39;secretary&#39; for punishment in the afternoon. Promptness and proper attire will keep further demerits from accumulating.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Mr. Johnson,&quot; Miss Payne says, a cruel smirk appearing on her face, &quot;I will make sure it happens.&quot; She turns to you. &quot;You&#39;ve caused enough trouble, go across the hall and wait for me like you were supposed to do.&quot;

As it shuts you let out a HUGE gasp of relief. Whatever is going on in that room, you want nothing more to do with it.

You open the correct door and slip inside. The room is dismal, populated only with a table, a few chairs and several rows of lockers. The table is covered in magazines like Cosmopolitan, Vogue, Today&#39;s Hairstyles and other such uninteresting items. There is a small, open door in the corner of the room, through which you can see a minuscule restroom. Before you have time to get your bearings, Miss Payne storms in behind you.

&quot;I&#39;m not going to cover for you again, you little bitch.  From now on you do what you&#39;re told, when you&#39;re told.  Do you understand me?&quot;

You nod, not really knowing what to say.

&quot;All right then.  This is the changing room. We have a very strict dress code here and to enforce that we insist that you keep your uniforms here.  They are laundered in house and ensure that our employees are always presentable.  Understood?&quot;

You nod your head yes.

&quot;Now before we continue, we need to discuss something. You have been hired for a position that we normally only hire pretty girls for.  As I&#39;m sure even you can understand, this puts us in an awkward position, since if we fire you we face accusations of discrimination. Yet the job you&#39;ve been hired for requires you to work closely with the other girls and we don&#39;t want any sexual tension in our work place.&quot;

[[Ask her just exactly what she is implying!|chastity]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="demand_explanation" tags="" position="475,350">&quot;Is everyone crazy around here?&quot; You point to the woman on the desk who still hasn&#39;t moved despite your intervention. &quot;This woman is being beaten and you apologize about ME?&quot;

All eyes turn in your direction. You get the distinct impression that you&#39;re about to have a full-fledged fight with both Miss Payne and the brute in the suit. Your body tenses and you&#39;re ready for anything.

Anything...Except for what happens.

The man throws back his head and laughs. You see a smirk appear on the corner of Miss Payne&#39;s face and for a moment you wonder if you&#39;re on a hidden camera show.

&quot;Looks like you&#39;ve got your hands full with this one,&quot; the man says. Miss Payne just shakes her head as if to say, &quot;you can&#39;t get good help these days.&quot; The guy steps close, looming above you like a professional wrestler. 

&quot;We&#39;ll discuss this more when you report for punishment.&quot;

He lingers for a moment to reinforce his authority and then moves back to his desk as if you and Miss Payne aren&#39;t even there. He smiles at the girl. &quot;Where were we, Katie? Was it forty-seven or forty-eight.  I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve lost count.  We&#39;d better start over, eh?&quot;

Miss Payne grabs your arm so hard it hurts and ushers you toward the door. The sound of the woman being spanked and her sobs of pain fill your ears until the door shuts and you find yourself staring into the hard eyes of Miss Payne.

&quot;You&#39;re going to regret that,&quot; she growls and pushes you toward the opposite door so hard that you nearly bang your head against it.

You manage to open the door before she shoves you through it and slip inside. The room is dismal, populated only with a table, a few chairs and several rows of lockers.

&quot;I can&#39;t have ANY of our employees, be it you or the girls, distracted from work by sexual tension.&quot;  You don&#39;t know exactly what to say. It feels like she&#39;s mad at you for being male.

&quot;I do believe we have a solution of sorts...&quot;

She holds up a piece of nasty looking metal. You don&#39;t know exactly what it is, but the sight of a tiny silver padlock dangling from the corner of it causes the hairs on the back of your neck to stand up.

&quot;What is that?&quot; you ask.

&quot;Its a chastity belt. It&#39;ll keep you and any...impulses...you might have under control. You&#39;ll put it on every morning, and come ask me for the key after work. Well? Come on...I haven&#39;t got all day. Drop your pants.&quot;

For a moment you stand there unmoving. She&#39;s got to be kidding. She can&#39;t expect you to let her lock up your penis.  Right?


[[There&#39;s no way in hell you&#39;re putting that thing on!|no_way][$score_dom += 1]]

&quot;I&#39;m not wearing it.&quot;

Your voice doesn&#39;t seem to have quite the authority that it did a minute ago. You blink and all of a sudden her hand has grabbed your face. You try to protest through puckered cheeks, but before you can, she leans forward. Her face is inches away from yours, her voice low and menacing.

&quot;Listen to me, you little, ungrateful bitch! We have a contract with your signature on it. The contract says that you will comply with the company dress code or face a severe penalty and fine. Well guess what? This...&quot; she holds up the chastity belt, &quot;...is part of the dress code. Now you&#39;ve royally pissed me off, so you better get those pants off NOW!&quot;

She pushes you away, causing you to lose your balance and almost fall over.

You deduce that the name indicates who owns the locker. The name above the locker she told you to use must have been a girl who used to work here.

&quot;Poor &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  Miss Payne probably ate her.&quot; Your chuckle sounds empty to your own ears. 

You open the locker and see a robe hanging from one of the hooks. You put your clothes inside and pull out the pink satiny garment with a look of trepidation. She can&#39;t possibly expect you to wear this thing.  It&#39;s the thought of standing here mostly naked in a chastity belt that gets you moving. Feeling horribly foolish, you slip the robe on and realize that you might as well take your shirt off as well. With the short sleeves and low cut front, the robe looks even more foolish with a button up shirt and tie underneath it. You hang up your shirt and slip the robe on again. This time you notice the monogrammed name on the chest: &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.

&lt;i&gt;&quot;She didn&#39;t even get to keep the robe when she left,&quot;&lt;/i&gt;  You tie the robe closed with the tiny pink string. Not that it makes you feel more modest. The almost see-through material only covers you down to the middle of your thigh, and the top is cut down below your breast bone. If all the girls around here wore these kinds of robes, it&#39;s no wonder they make everyone wear chastity belts.

Miss Payne chuckles when she sees you.

&quot;C&#39;mon &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; she mocks as you step into the elevator. She swipes her card, pushes a button and the elevator rockets upward. &quot;Before we continue your training, its company policy that all employees familiarize themselves with the products and services that M&amp;R provides.&quot; The elevator door opens and you find yourself in a tiny room with a large, odd looking table in the center. A pretty redheaded woman appears and suppresses a smirk at the sight of you. You can&#39;t help but blush.

&quot;Hi. I&#39;m Penny,&quot; the redheaded woman says. &quot;welcome to the M&amp;R family. You&#39;ve been scheduled for a spa, massage and grooming session.  Lucky for you, we have two attendants available. Which would make you more comfortable sweetie? Male or female?&quot;

&lt;i&gt;&quot;How does she move so quickly?&quot; &lt;/i&gt;The thought barely has time to register before your misplaced momentum carries you to the floor. You feel yourself being flipped over. The horrible woman puts a knee on your chest, pinning you underneath her weight.

&quot;I just KNEW you were going to be a pain in my ass,&quot; she growls. You wince as you realize that you can barely breathe with her weight on your chest. You try to push her off, but the leverage is wrong.

&quot;Now are you going to take your pants off,&quot; she asks in a tone that oozes sarcastic sweetness, &quot;or do you want ME to do it for you?&quot;

The world is starting to spin as the last bit of oxygen in your lungs expires. You feel hands fumbling at your fly and it takes you a moment before you realize that they&#39;re your own. Wriggling like a fish, you work your pants down until they bunch up around your shoes. Only then does the pressure ease up on your chest. You scramble to a sitting position gasping for breath while Miss Payne examines the state of her fingernails. She gives you a tiny nod to indicate that the pants should come all the way off. Your face flames with anger and humiliation as you pull off your shoes and socks and let the pants slide off your body.

You stand up, your hands covering your privates as best they can . She looks at you nonplussed.

&quot;Those too,&quot; she mumbles. It takes you a moment before you realize she means your underwear. You start to protest, but the anger that flashes in her eyes takes what little fight you have left. Every scrap of dignity departs as your undergarment joins the pile of clothing. She tosses you the odd-shaped garment and the color drains out of your face as you begin to slide it on. It fits like a thong with a long sleeve in the front for your equipment.  The front of the material has what feels like a hard, metal plate sewn into the lining, while a tiny cloth strap slides between your butt cheeks to connect up to a small clasp on the band around your waist. With the garment in place, Miss Payne struts over and stands behind you. She fiddles with the clasp for a minute, ratcheting the thing back and forth. You feel the garment getting tighter and tighter and the sleeve that you tucked yourself into begins to compress and pull downward and back. You start to protest but the thought of her kneeling on your chest stifles any complaints.  You feel your limp organ manipulated more and more until the sleeve is as tight as it could possible be, pointing your penis straight down toward the floor between your legs.  It&#39;s not quite painful, but it is horribly constricting and you wonder how you got yourself into this position. Finally she stops pulling and you hear a click of what can only be a locking mechanism. Your heart beats double duty as you look down and see the lack of equipment below. The front of the metal plate completely covers the sheath that your penis is held in.  At a casual glance it looks like you&#39;re wearing thong underwear and that you have absolutely no equipment inside of it.  This does not make you feel any better about this situation.

&quot;The second locker from the end is free. Put your clothes in it. There is a robe inside. Put it on and meet me at the elevator.&quot; She bursts out the door like a tornado, leaving you staring at the lockers.

&quot;Male&quot; you mumble.  You realize after you say it that this implies to the ladies that you might like the idea of being rubbed down by a guy. Neither woman seems to care. Miss Payne has already stepped back into the elevator saying over her shoulder, &quot;Buzz me when it&#39;s done.&quot; The elevator zooms off and the pretty redhead is already guiding you to the table.

&quot;I&#39;ll go get Jacob,&quot; she says. &quot;Take your robe off and lie on the table. He&#39;ll be in shortly.&quot;

You wait for the woman to leave the room before stripping the garment off. The chastity belt leaves you feeling awfully exposed and you look around for a towel to drape over yourself. There isn&#39;t one. Embarrassed, you quickly clamber up onto the table and lie face down with your head pointed through the hole at the head of the table. A pair of feet which you can only assume belong to Jacob, appear in your vision.

&quot;Hi,&quot; says the deep booming voice above you. &quot;Welcome to the team. I&#39;m going to be giving you a combination massage/skin treatment.&quot;  He begins to explain the session to you and you zone out.  Instead of listening you take the opportunity to sneak a peek at your masseuse.  The first thing that you notice is that he&#39;s not wearing a shirt.  Its hard not to notice.  The man has muscles that look like small mountains.  His face is well proportioned, clean shaven and ruggedly handsome.  You feel horribly inadequate in his presence.  You&#39;re about to put your face back down on the table when your eyes glance down to his shorts.  There is a clear outline of his penis through the spandex.  This man isn&#39;t wearing a chastity belt.  You can&#39;t contain your outrage.  They made you wear one while this guy rubs his hands all over naked women all day.  Your face burns with anger and you put it back down on the table.

You feel a cool liquid pour onto your skin and then his soft, yet strong hands begin massaging your muscles. This does great strides to relieve the tension that had barricaded itself into your body.  The liquid tingles as it gets worked into your pores almost to the point of discomfort, but the talented hands of Jacob distract more than enough. His hands cover every inch of your body, even some places that cause you more than a little embarrassment. You flinch as his fingers, slip into the crevice of your ass and work their way along the edges of your chastity belt.  The tiny strap running between your cheeks feels like virtually no protection from his fingers and you squirm involuntarily as his fingers slide underneath the strap coating the lotion deep in between your cheeks.    What kind of massage is this?

Then just as you&#39;re about to protest, his hands disappear and he instructs you to flip over. For the first time since you put it on, you&#39;re both grateful for and horribly humiliated by the chastity belt. It would be different if this guy was wearing one too, but he&#39;s not. He&#39;s OBVIOUSLY not.  Without thinking about it, your eyes drift down to the guy&#39;s crotch.  Why you and not him?  With a sudden embarrassment, you realize you&#39;re staring at the outline of his dick.  You glance up at his face to see if he noticed.  If the smirk on his lips doesn&#39;t give you your answer, the wink does.  You close your eyes quickly, cheeks flaming and heart-rate drumming up-tempo. He rubs down your front and you try with all your might not to dwell on how uncomfortable and self-conscious you are.  You focus instead on trying to speculate some reason why you should be singled out for chastity.  No reasonable answers spring to mind.

Your thoughts are diverted as you feel his hands caress the edge of your chastity belt again.  As he rubs the lotion into your inner thighs, you feel your member betray you.  It tries to spring to life, but the tight cylinder around it cuts the blood flow.  It tries again, but to no effect except a borderline painful yearning between your legs.  You&#39;re both tremendously thankful for the thing (after all you don&#39;t want a raging erection as this guy rubs you down) but at the same time horrified at the thought that you can&#39;t get hard while wearing it.  His hands begin to deeply massage your thighs and for a third time your penis tries to swell.  When it finds that it can&#39;t, it spits a tiny spurt of built up semen.  Your embarrassment knows no end, even though it appears that Jacob didn&#39;t even notice.  If he did, he shows no sign and only continues to massage the lotion (now mixed with your own liquid) into your legs.  Despite your embarrassment, a dawning horror is filling your mind as well.  There was no pleasure from the spurt between your legs, just an obvious release of useless liquid.  Worse yet, the spurt seems to only encourage your member to WANT to expand.  Your can feel your face glowing as you realize that you are more than a little horny.

After what seems like an eternity, his hands disappear. You&#39;ve almost gone to sleep, prevented only by the tingling of the lotion that seems to have intensified with every passing second and the incessant throbbing inside the infernal belt.

&quot;Brace yourself,&quot; Jacob says. Before you have a chance to ask what he means, a horrible cold pain surrounds your body. You can&#39;t breathe and you gasp in a big mouthful of water. The cascade seems to go on forever and despite the freezing cold, you feel the tingling lotion on your body wash away.  Then its over and you&#39;re left lying on the table in a cold, shivering heap. Between your legs, your equipment shrivels from the shock. It might be your imagination but it almost feels like the chastity belt takes up the slack. You have a sinking suspicion that as your member shrunk, so did the sleeve holding it.  You have a bad feeling that it&#39;s not going to allow your equipment to go back to the size it was only moments ago.

Jacob begins to pat you dry and you notice that your skin feels oddly sensitive to the soft towel. You open your eyes and sit up. For a moment you can&#39;t understand what happened. Your legs are completely hairless. So are your arms. For that matter your whole body from the neck down doesn&#39;t have a scrap of hair on it. The lotion must have been some sort of hair removal product. Not only that but you&#39;re now aware of the smell emanating from your pores. You still smell like the lotion. Jacob smiles at you, holding out your robe.

Besides, every woman you have seen in this building so far has been absolutely stunning. If that trend continues, you might end up with a knock-out rubbing her hands all over you.

You mumble, &quot;Female.&quot;  You&#39;re a little worried that the women in front of you will think you&#39;re a pervert, but neither one seems to care. Miss Payne has already stepped back into the elevator and as the doors slide shut she says, &quot;Buzz me when it&#39;s done.&quot; Then the horrible woman is gone and the pretty redhead is leading you to the table.

&quot;I&#39;ll go get Samantha,&quot; she says, &quot;Take your robe off and lie on the table. She&#39;ll be in shortly.&quot;  You wait for the woman to leave the room before stripping the garment off. The chastity belt leaves you feeling awfully exposed and embarrassed. You clamber up onto the table and lie face down with your head pointing through the hole at the head of the table. A pair of feet and shapely legs suddenly appears in your vision.

&quot;Hi,&quot; says a musical voice above you, &quot;welcome to the team. I&#39;m going to be giving you a combination massage/skin treatment session. She continues her spiel about what the massage entails and you take the opportunity to sneak a peek at her.

The first thing you notice, hell it&#39;s hard not to notice, is that she&#39;s barely wearing anything.  Her breasts are huge, bursting out of a bikini top.  Tight blue shorts hug her figure, emphasizing her tiny waist.  Then you see her face and wonder if you died and went to heaven.  Raven hair tickles her shoulders, her red-ruby lips gleaming against her darker skin.  She looks as if she has some sort of Japanese ancestry, although you can&#39;t recall having ever seen a Japanese girl with breasts this size before.  You feel an instant throb inside the chastity belt and the horrible device constricts around your member keeping it tiny and limp.  Maybe it IS a good idea to wear this thing. How embarrassing it would be to have this woman see how excited you got at just her appearance.

You feel a cool liquid pour onto your skin and then her soft, yet decidedly strong hands begin massaging your muscles. The liquid tingles as it gets worked into your pores almost to the point of discomfort, but the talented hands of Samantha distract more than enough. Her hands cover every inch of your body, even some places that cause you more than a little embarrassment. You flinch as her fingers slip into the crevice of your ass and work their way along the edges of your chastity belt.  The tiny strap between your cheeks feels like virtually no protection from her and you squirm as her fingers slide behind the material to the deep recesses.  What kind of massage is this?

Then her hands disappear and she instructs you to flip over. You&#39;re both grateful and horribly humiliated by the chastity belt. You wonder if the girl is wearing one too. Without thinking about it, your eyes drift down to her crotch.  You stare at it for a long minute, but can&#39;t tell. With a sudden embarrassment, you realize where you&#39;re staring and glance up at her face to see if she noticed.  If the smirk on her lips doesn&#39;t give you your answer, the wink does.  You close your eyes quickly, cheeks flaming and heart-rate drumming up-tempo. She rubs down your front and you try with all your might not to dwell on how uncomfortable and self-conscious you are.

You&#39;re both tremendously thankful for the thing (after all you don&#39;t want a raging erection as this woman does her job) but at the same time horrified at the thought that you can&#39;t get hard while wearing it.  Her hands begin to deeply massage your thighs and for a third time your penis tries to swell.  When it finds that it can&#39;t, it spits a tiny spurt of built up semen.

Your can feel your face glowing as you realize that you are more than a little horny.

After what seems like an eternity, her hands disappear. You&#39;ve almost gone to sleep, prevented only by the tingling of the lotion that seems to have intensified with every passing second and the nonstop throbbing in your belt. 

&quot;Brace yourself,&quot; Samantha says. Before you have a chance to ask what she means, a horrible cold pain surrounds your body. You can&#39;t breathe and you gasp in a big mouthful of water.

&quot;It&#39;s a patented M&amp;R creation. Scented defoliation lotion. It doesn&#39;t smell of chemicals because of it&#39;s made of all natural botanical ingredients and human pheromones.  It has yet to cause an allergic reaction on a single person. It&#39;s one of our most popular products. Miss Payne insists that the entire secretarial pool try it out immediately so that they can push the product on the phone.&quot;

You start to explain to him that you&#39;re not a secretary, but a data entry worker. Before you get a chance, he nudges you with an elbow.

&quot;Wait till you see the reaction you get.  The guys will be all over you.  Those pheromones are lethal.&quot;

Before you have a chance to question this statement, a chime sounds indicating that your session is finished. Appearing out of nowhere, Penny returns.

Miss Payne requires everyone in the secretarial pool to experience it so that it can be sold more effectively on the phone.

[[Click here to continue.|beauty][$image_name = &#39;default&#39;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="37" name="beauty" tags="" position="850,475">Penny leads you through several intricate hallways, chattering away all the while.  You barely hear her.  Your smooth and sensitive skin causes you to be aware of your every movement.  The satin robe caresses you with a slightly ticklish embrace. The swelling in your chastity belt is more than uncomfortable now, bordering on painful.  The pain isn&#39;t a deterrent to the throbbing thing between your legs, however.  If anything it makes it more eager.  You&#39;re more than a little upset that they removed all your body hair, but you have to admit it does FEEL really good. At least your trapped member thinks so.  You might not be able to change clothes at the gym for a while, but every movement you make is excruciatingly pleasant.

The chatty redhead ushers you into a small room with a big, nasty-looking chair in the middle.  It reminds you of a dentist chair and you&#39;re once again filled with a trepidation about being here.

&quot;Have a seat,&quot; Penny says, heading for the door. &quot;They&#39;ll be with you in a minute.&quot; 

She disappears and not knowing what else to do, you sit in the chair.

Mere seconds later, four people burst into the room.  Three of them barely even acknowledge your existence and go straight to the counter behind you and dig through the drawers of grooming supplies.  The fourth one stands over you. &quot;Hi.  I&#39;m Naomi.  Welcome to the team.&quot;

&quot;The first thing we need to do is whiten your teeth,&quot; her voice is so perky it hurts your head.  She goes to the counter, grabs a handful of stuff and returns over talking all the way.

&quot;Do you drink coffee?  I&#39;ll bet you do.  Soda maybe?&quot; She squeezes a tube of green goo into a bit of plastic.  &quot;Doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; she has yet to let you answer, &quot;In a few minutes you&#39;re going to have a dazzling white smile.  Now listen...this process is patented by this company.  It&#39;s crucial that you don&#39;t move your mouth after your teeth are in this mold.  It will halt the whitening process, but also the solution is not a good thing to swallow.  We had one girl who was nauseous for the better part of a week, so keep your mouth still.  Do you understand?&quot;

You nod your head dumbfounded and before you&#39;re fully aware of what&#39;s happening, she&#39;s positioning the piece of gooey plastic into your mouth.  You feel your teeth snap into the groove, and the plastic mold hinges open, locking your jaw as open as it will go.  She sticks a tube into your mouth that begins to syphon off excess saliva.

&quot;I&#39;ll be back in thirty minutes,&quot; she says as if its no time at all. &quot;Remember, don&#39;t move your mouth if you can help it.&quot;  You watch her disappear out the door.  You doubt you could move your mouth anyway.  The mold has it locked all the way open and biting down against the horrible gooey plastic mold causes your teeth to feel soft.

A slightly effeminate guy appears in front of you next.  He&#39;s putting on the second of his clear protective gloves and you wonder with a little trepidation what he&#39;s protecting his hands from.

&quot;Well,&quot; he says putting his gloved hands on his hips, &quot;You&#39;re going to be a bit of work aren&#39;t you?&quot;  You glare at him, unable to talk because of the dental mold.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, sweetie, we&#39;ll get you all fixed up.&quot;

He pushes a lever on the chair, which causes you to slide backward.  Your head is horizontal to the floor and he looms over you, holding what looks like a shower nozzle.  He begins to hose down your hair, letting the water drain down into the floor beneath you.  He holds your head as he massages shampoo into your hair. Out of the corner of your vision you can see one of the other women kneeling at your feet.  You flinch as she touches your left one and begins attacking your nails with an Emory board.  The other woman has rolled a cart of boxes over to your right hand side and is frantically digging through them. 

&quot;So listen sweetie,&quot; the guy massaging your head says, &quot;First we need to decide on a color. We&#39;ve been asked to let you sample our dye process, but I&#39;ll be nice this morning and let you have a choice in this. No one would be happy if we let you do anything too outrageous, but I&#39;ll let you have a little fun.   I know you can&#39;t talk with that thing in your mouth, so just blink once for blond, twice for red, three times for chestnut or four for raven.&quot;

You blink rapidly trying to get him to pay attention and stop what he&#39;s doing, but he seems oblivious to your discomfort.  You try talking, but it causes a nasty fluoride taste in your mouth and you quickly stop trying to make noise.  It all sounded like vowels anyway.  The guy rinses out your hair and begins to apply a horrible smelling application to it.

&quot;We&#39;ve got to bleach you,&quot; he says, smearing in more horrible liquid. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, you won&#39;t be a platinum, we&#39;ll add some color back in.&quot;

The tickling causes you to squirm.  Everyone seems unaware of your discomfort.  The final woman has appeared in your line of vision and smiles down at you with a slightly condescending smile.

&quot;You&#39;ve really let those eyebrows get out of control, girlfriend,&quot; she says with just the slightest suggestion of a neck roll thrown in.  You&#39;re trying to figure out what she means, when your eyes focus on the tweezers she brandishes only inches above your face.  She begins attacking your brows and tears instantly well up in your eyes and roll down your cheeks.  Holy crap is it painful!  But worst of all is the thought that has rocketed into your brain.  She called you &#39;girlfriend&#39;.

They think you&#39;re a girl!

What are they?  Stupid?  Just because you&#39;re wearing the stupid robe and all your body hair has been washed away, these stupid twits think you&#39;re a woman.   If only they hadn&#39;t put the horrible bleaching thing in your mouth.  You want to give these stupid people a piece of your mind.

She seems to work on your left eyebrow forever.  Hair after hair after hair painfully ripped away.  Behind you, the bleach is being rinsed off.  The guy mumbles to himself applying a different, bad smelling liquid which you can only assume is the hair color.  There&#39;s no sign of the woman who put the teeth whitening gel in your mouth, but the woman at your feet has moved upward and taken hold of your left hand.

&quot;Your nails are horrible,&quot; she says in between chews of her gum. &quot;I&#39;m gonna give you some fake ones.  We have three kinds...so blink once if you want short, twice for medium and three times for the extra long ones.&quot;

You can&#39;t believe this is happening.  They&#39;re making you look like a girl!  How did you end up in this situation?  You wish you could say something.  ANYTHING!

The woman working on your brows, plucks what feels like a dozen hairs in one pull and your eyes pour down tears.  You blink them away as best you can, realizing only after you&#39;ve done it that the woman took that as the answer to her question.

&quot;Long it is,&quot; she laughs. &quot;I had mine this length for a few months, but it&#39;s just so hard to do anything.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get used to them though.&quot;

You try to pull your hand away from her, but she has it in a death grip and begins applying a sticky substance to each nail.  The woman working on your brows finally stops, takes a deep breath and then plunges back in on the other one.  Your whole forehead is aching from the process and your heart skips a beat as you think about how much she must have shaped the first one.  It doesn&#39;t feel like you have an eyebrow left.

You can certainly feel your hair though.  Between the bleach and the dye it feels extra sensitive, not to mention the fact that the guy is pulling on big chunks of it.  He must be fastening the attachments to it and you can only hope that they can be undone easily.  If nothing else you can have them cut off.  Hell after today maybe you&#39;ll shave your head.  Let&#39;s see them mistake you for a girl then.

&quot;What color nails ya&#39; want, honey?&quot; the woman holding your hand asks. &quot;We&#39;ve got Naughty Red or School Girl Pink.  Blink once or twice.&quot;


[[Blink once for red.|nails][$nail_color = &quot;red&quot;]]
[[Blink twice for pink.|nails][$nail_color = &quot;pink&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name="nails" tags="" position="350,600">&quot;Can do,&quot; she says presses hard on each fingertip as she applies the fake nails.  You can&#39;t wait till you get these women off of you just so you can rip the damn things back off again.  Each one she puts on your hand makes it feel more and more alien.

The other woman finally stops attacking your brows and you feel a huge surge of relief as she sets the tweezers down.  Maybe she didn&#39;t pluck them as badly as you think she did.  She comes back into your line of sight and this time carries something more horrifying than the tweezers.

She begins to rub the makeup all over your face and neck, leaving no spot untouched.  You squirm around in protest, but it does no good.  She proceeds to apply all manner of powders and liquids to your face.  She paints your lips with a glossy color that matches your new nails.  She goops black mascara all over your eyelashes.  They&#39;re so long that  everytime you blink it feels like you create a gale of wind.  She tints your cheeks with blush and practically pokes your eye out outlining your eye with liner.

&quot;The good news is,&quot; she says so sweetly that you want to punch her in the face,&quot;this makeup is another state of the art M&amp;R.  It&#39;s waterproof and lasts at least a month...sometimes two.  It&#39;ll save you hours everyday!&quot;

You look up at her, eyes wide.  You&#39;re wearing makeup that won&#39;t come off for a MONTH?

You have your eyes closed trying to deny the whole horrible situation when you feel the prick and burn in your left ear.

&quot;I&#39;m going to put some semi-permanent studs in your ears, all right sweetie?&quot; she says poking something in your ear, &quot;We&#39;ll use some tweezers to remove them once you&#39;re ready for bigger earrings, but for now...&quot; you try to shake your head to get her to stop, but she easily pierces your other ear with the skill of a trained professional.  &quot;...we don&#39;t want these healing back.  Plus these little studs are ultra cute.&quot;

&quot;Good luck on your first day,&quot;  she says as she finishes inserting the other studded earring. &quot;The first is always overwhelming.  You&#39;ll be fine.  You&#39;ll see.&quot; 

She disappears out the door, as the other woman finishes the nails on your right hand.  She moves back between your legs and begins painting your toenails with a matching color.  You&#39;re uncomfortably aware that she has a very good view  up your short, pink robe.  You close your legs at the knees, trying to limit the view.  As your smooth thighs rub together your locked away member tries to show its appreciation, but fails and squirts a small stream of goo into your closed thighs.  Just when it seems like you can&#39;t get anymore embarrassed, something like this happens.  As long as you keep your legs closed though, hopefully the woman won&#39;t notice. 

The guy working on your hair finally stops tugging on it, and raises the chair back up to the sitting position.  Your new, long locks drape down in front of your face with a wet smack.  It comes down to the middle of your chest in deep waves that seem completely natural.

He begins to attack it with a comb and blow dryer, adding all kinds of sprays and mists to it.  It begins to fluff out and tickle the sides of your face and the back of your neck.  You wonder again, not for the first time, how the hell you ended up in this position.

The girl finishes your toes almost exactly as the guy steps back and turns the blow dryer off.  They both wish you a great first day and then disappear out the door, leaving you alone with nothing more than a horrible tasting mouth piece and a disturbingly feminine feeling appearance.

As if on cue, the first woman comes back in and pulls the dental mold out of your mouth.  She hands you a bottle of water and tells you to rinse and spit at least ten times.  You&#39;re unsure where to spit and it must show on your face.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; she laughs, &quot;just spit right on the floor.  Everything drains, and we hose it down between clients.&quot;

You don&#39;t need anymore instruction.  Your mouth feels horrible and tastes worse.  You swish the water around in your mouth and spit.  It still tastes terrible.  You rinse again.

&quot;I&#39;ve got another appointment sweetie,&quot; she says as you fill your mouth for the third time. &quot;You turned out gorgeous.  The Managers are gonna be all over you.  Good luck today.&quot;  Then she&#39;s gone and you&#39;re all alone.

After the thirteenth rinse your mouth feels better, but your spirits sink.  You&#39;ve just had a complete feminine make-over.  They thought you were a girl when you walked in so you can only imagine what you look like now!  You feel a desperate need to find a mirror and see what they&#39;ve done to you.  More importantly, you want to find a way downstairs to get your clothes and get the hell out of this crazy place!


[[Find a mirror.|mirror][$image_name = &#39;payne&#39;]]

The woman sanded off all of your calluses and the wet tile floor causes them to tingle as if they were dipped in seltzer water.  You&#39;re uncomfortably aware of the goo that is slowly dripping down your thigh.  Your penis throbs again in its restraint and you feel a desperate need for relief. Despite the indignities that have been thrust upon you, you&#39;re beyond horny.  The fact that there is nothing you can do about it only seems to make it more powerful.  Another small squirt of goo gushes against your smooth thighs as they rub together.  You&#39;ve got to get the key to this horrible belt and then get out of here!  But first, you&#39;ve got to find a mirror and do damage control.  You look around.

There are no mirrors.

You peer out the door and when you realize the hallway is empty, you make a break for it, rushing toward the elevators.  There was a mirror on the wall in the elevator alcove.  You just hope and pray no one sees you.  Your new hair swishes across your face as you run and you curse under your breath at how ticklish it is.

You turn the corner and see the alcove in the distance.  In seconds the end of the corridor rushes up to meet you and you find yourself face to face with a beautiful woman.

YOU!

This can&#39;t be possible.

The woman staring out at you from the ornate wall hanging can&#39;t be you.

And yet every move you make is mimicked by the beautiful reflection.  Pain rips through your groin as your chastity belt counteracts your natural impulse. It spits in protest adding to the growing stream of liquid creeping down your thigh.  The vision in front of you looks like something out of a pinup magazine.  The woman&#39;s eyes dart back and forth as she seems to study you.

Long, flowing &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; locks.  Shiny &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; lips.  Pale, creamy skin.  Long perfect fingernails.  There&#39;s even a faint trace of a blush on her cheeks.  You can&#39;t quite tell if its makeup or real.  The pink satin robe only emphasizes the image.  Draped around your skinny frame, you look like a Playboy model right before the big reveal.

How the hell did they do this to you?  You&#39;re a guy, for chrissake.  How could they turn you into this luscious image so easily.

The girl in front of you tilts her head and looks back at you quizzically.  One of delicately manicured hands goes up to touch the zirconium stud in her ear.  You can&#39;t help it.  A tiny grin appears on your face, echoing on hers.  She has dazzling white teeth, a smile that would melt the polar ice caps.  A naughty image of what you&#39;d like to do to this woman passes through your mind, your dick throbs in its confines and suddenly terror fills you.  They&#39;ve turned you into every man&#39;s wet dream and you&#39;re standing alone in a hallway, with nothing more than the thin, tiny robe covering your body.

&quot;Well...you turned out well,&quot; a sardonic voice says behind you.  You spin around already knowing who it is.

Another small squirt of goo gushes against your smooth thighs as they rub together.  You&#39;ve got to get the key to this horrible belt and then get out of here!

But first you have to find something less revealing than this robe.  Long styled locks of &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; hair drop into your face and you try to pull the extensions out.  No luck.  You can&#39;t even figure out where the extensions begin and your actual hair ends.  The impossibly long &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; nails on your fingers don&#39;t let you get a good grip on it anyway.   You try to pull off one of the nails but a blinding pain erupts from your cuticle and you quickly give up.  The things are really on there...and they&#39;re tough too.  You&#39;re gonna have to figure out a way to cut them off.  But that&#39;s later.

You cautiously peer out the door and when you realize the hallway is empty, you make a break for it, rushing down the hall toward the elevators. You just hope and pray no one sees you.  Your new &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; hair swishes across your face and back as you run. You curse under your breath at how ticklish it is.

You make it to the elevators, panting from your scurry.  Thank God that no one saw you.

Then your heart sinks.  In all of your panic you forgot one really important thing.

The elevators need a keycard.  A keycard you don&#39;t have.  Your clothes are on the 9th floor and you&#39;re stuck up here!  You&#39;ll have to find stairs.

&quot;Well...you turned out well,&quot; a sardonic voice says behind you. You spin around already knowing who it is.

&quot;You&#39;re looking more like M&amp;R material all ready.&quot;  Before you can think of running, she approaches. She looms over you, a staggeringly powerful, dark-haired office Amazon.  One of her hands goes to your cheek in what would be affection coming from anyone else.  For her, the gesture oozes condescension.  &quot;You&#39;re quite the pretty little thing.  Love that &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; hair.  And those nails.  They don&#39;t normally make them that long.  You must have asked them for those, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

You glare at her, fury burning out of your eyes.  SHE did this to you.  She knew you were a guy and intentionally let everyone think you were a woman so they would make you look this way.  You can barely contain your rage.

&quot;You did this!&quot; you growl. &quot;You made them turn me into a girl!&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t take much did it?&quot; she chuckles, grabbing your cheeks and turning your head so she can examine your makeup.  You grimace as she inspects you like a piece of meat.  &quot;Besides...you&#39;ll fit in much better with the other secretaries this way.&quot;

You jerk your head away from her grasp.

&quot;You are an ungrateful, little bitch, you know that?&quot; she spits at you. &quot;We&#39;ve just allowed you to try out a seven hundred dollar spa session and you&#39;re upset because we&#39;ve made you a little more presentable.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve made me look like a joke!&quot; you spit back.

&quot;You didn&#39;t need any help from us!&quot; She grabs your arm and begins dragging you back toward the elevator. You resist, pulling back and digging your heels in until she begins to grind the bones of your wrist so hard that you cry out.

She swipes her card and turns to you while the two of you wait for the elevator to arrive.

&quot;A word of advice, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  You&#39;re on my bad list. You&#39;d better watch your P&#39;s and Q&#39;s or I&#39;m going to make your life here a living hell!&quot;

She moves like a lightning bolt, slamming you hard against the elevator doors. Her face hovers only inches from yours, her eyes burning with fury.

&quot;First of all,&quot; she says, her voice little more than a whisper, &quot;don&#39;t EVER correct me!&quot;

You whimper as she squeezes your arms so hard that you seriously doubt you&#39;ll be able to make a fist for the rest of the day.

&quot;And second of all...&quot; her mouth goes right up to your ear, the words so soft that you can barely hear them. &quot;...what is the name on your robe...&quot;

She squeezes again and pain shoots through your arms.

&quot;First of all,&quot; she says, her voice little more than a whisper, &quot;don&#39;t EVER correct me!&quot;

You whimper as she presses you harder against the doors, your captured hand almost touching the back of your neck.

&quot;And second of all...&quot; her mouth goes right up to your ear, the words so soft that you can barely hear them. &quot;...what is the name on your robe...&quot;

Her other hand lands on your hip. Even through the pain you can feel the heat of it through the skimpy material that separates it from your skin.

Another pinch, this one hard enough to cause a bruise.  Tears fill your eyes from the combination of pain and frustration.

&quot;So your name is...&quot; She squeezes your arm even harder than you thought possible. Yet still you hold back. You clench your teeth against the pain.

&quot;That&#39;s a good girl,&quot; Miss Payne says, her evil grin wrapping all the way around her head.

She releases the death grip on your arm but keeps you pinned against the elevator door.  You feel her hand on the backside of your upper thigh and the tenderness of it against your smooth skin causes goose flesh to break out on your skin.  What is she doing?

The hand creeps upward tracing the curve of your rear. Your tiny, shrunken cock tries to respond and the unrelenting belt stops it.  Even as it happens you can&#39;t believe how easily your body has betrayed you.  This horrible woman has turned you on with a single caress of her hand.  You feel her touch snake down between your legs.

&quot;You like this, don&#39;t you, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  You&#39;re all wet.&quot;  Your body betrays you again by spurting another unsatisfying burst down onto her fingers.

She presses her body up against yours from behind, her hand tracing the curve of your butt, spreading the sticky liquid on your skin. Her lips practically touch your ear.

&quot;Tell me your name again,&quot; she whispers seductively, her voice causing the hairs on your neck to stand up.  She takes your ear lobe between her lips and bites.  Pain and pleasure fill your senses.

&quot;&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; you mumble unable to stop the pleasure radiating through your body from her gentle caress.  It&#39;s not just your trapped penis that&#39;s throbbing now...it&#39;s your whole body.

The door shuts and you breathe a sigh of relief.  Finally!  You can change out of this despicable, pink robe and back into your normal clothes. Maybe now you can figure out a way to undo the atrocities this woman has done to you.

You hurry over to the locker.  Your long, &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; hair swishes into your face and tickles the back of your neck.  The smooth skin of your thighs tingles as your legs brush against each other.  Every move you make seems to emphasize the changes forced upon you.

You fumble with the latch on the locker.  The horrible, &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; nails prevent you from doing the simplest of tasks.  Even opening your locker takes the utmost concentration and dexterity.

Finally you wiggle it open.

Your clothes aren&#39;t there.

You look up at the name to double check that you&#39;ve opened the right one.  The locker reads: &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.

Your clothes are gone.  In their place sits a shrink-wrapped package. Did they dry clean your clothes?  You glance back at Miss Payne.  She seems completely oblivious to you, all of her attention focused on one of her short-cropped nails.  Without looking up she mutters, &quot;Put your clothes on, girl.  I don&#39;t have all day!&quot;

A bad feeling settles into the pit of your stomach as you open the plastic package in your locker.  You suspect that you already know what this is.

She walks over to you and snatches the package out of your hands.

&quot;Take your robe off.&quot;

Sheepishly, you slip the robe off your shoulders and hang it on the hook in your locker.  You honestly can&#39;t remember having been more embarrassed than this.  Your skin glows from the lotion of the massage, emphasized by the lack of even a single hair.  You cover your asexual crotch with your hands as if you had any modesty left.

She pulls out the first item in the bag and holds it up.  You shiver.

&quot;Some girls don&#39;t need this,&quot; she says to you, wrapping the waist cincher around your middle and fastening it in the back, &quot;but you need the extra shaping.&quot;

You feel the breath get forcibly pushed out of you as she yanks hard at the cords behind your back.  She pulls again and you almost topple over, stopping yourself only by grabbing onto the table.  Again she pulls and you drag the table a few inches trying to not fall over.

You can&#39;t breathe.

That&#39;s right.  Ok.  Thank you.&quot;  She turns to look at you with a condescending smirk.  &quot;She&#39;s on her way.&quot;

You&#39;re beginning to think you made a mistake.  If Miss Payne is wary of this woman, then she must be scary indeed.  Time seems to stand still as you and the horrible woman stare at each other in silence.  Then the door bursts open.

You&#39;re not sure exactly what you were expecting, but it most certainly was not what came through the door.  Miss Daniels is strikingly beautiful, small of stature and possesses an almost indescribable cuteness.  She looks at you with a genuine smile and a tilted questioning head as if to say, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;Well what&#39;s wrong with it?&quot; She stoops to pick up the plastic bag that holds the uniform and inspects it as if she expects to find something wrong with it.  You find yourself completely speechless.  You want to explain to her that you&#39;re not a girl and therefore shouldn&#39;t be expected to wear this stupid outfit.  You want to tell her how horrible Miss Payne has been to you and that she should be fired right here and right now.  You want to threaten her with a lawsuit over the way you&#39;ve been treated since you arrived here this morning.  But her cheerfulness has caught you off guard and you find yourself stammering.

&quot;Its...um...well...&quot; the words just aren&#39;t coming, &quot;Its a skirt...&quot;

She looks at you with a sad understanding.

&quot;You&#39;re another tomboy aren&#39;t you?&quot; she asks, the smile widening on her face, &quot;I knew it when I walked in here.  Its nothing to be ashamed of.  I bet you&#39;re feeling overwhelmed from the spa treatment too.  All that girly stuff right when you first get here.&quot;

You nod, your mouth opening to add that you&#39;re not a tomboy but an actual boy.  A guy that was made up to look like a pretty girl.

&quot;Well don&#39;t worry your pretty little head about it,&quot; she says.  One of her arms goes around your shoulders and she squeezes softly in a friendly gesture of support.  &quot;You&#39;ve got a beautiful face, nice legs and a decent figure.  With a little enhancement up top, you&#39;ll be a knock out.  You&#39;ll see.  In a week or two you&#39;ll wonder why you ever dressed any way OTHER than this.&quot;

She smiles down at you and you finally manage to get the words out of your throat.

&quot;It&#39;s just that...I&#39;m not a girl.  I won&#39;t wear that outfit.&quot;  There.  You said it.  You can feel your cheeks turn red with humiliation.  She actually thought you were a girl.  You wait to see the embarrassment on her face when she realizes her mistake.

It doesn&#39;t come.

&quot;Oh,&quot; she says.  She peers at you for a second, scrutinizing your appearance. &quot;I see.&quot; She turns to Miss Payne.  &quot;THIS the one you were telling me about?&quot;  Miss Payne nods, smirking.  Miss Daniels shakes her head grinning.  &quot;Well.  You were right.  She&#39;ll do fine.&quot;  She turns back to you.  &quot;Here&#39;s the deal, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;...&quot;

&quot;Our secretaries do more than just answer the phone, as you know from the job description in your contract.  This company is run on one very basic principle.  Sex sells.  Where most companies sneak around this, pretending to be supportive of the idea that women are non-sexual creatures, we embrace the notion.  Which brings us to you.  From the way you&#39;re turning out...I think you&#39;ll fit in fine.  I know this is probably a bit of an...adjustment for you, but honestly...with the way you look...this can&#39;t be the first time you&#39;ve been mistaken for a woman right?&quot;

You stutter in outrage.

&quot;Did you get her equipment locked up?&quot; she asks Miss Payne.  Miss Payne nods with an evil smirk all over her face.  &quot;Then you&#39;re right.  She&#39;ll fit in just fine.  No one would guess she&#39;s not another one of our sexpots.  Maybe a little more training will be needed...probably some implants...&quot;

Your face pales.  She can&#39;t mean...

&quot;Please...I&#39;m not...&quot; you start to say.  You&#39;re cut off by a Beedly-Boop of her pager going off.  Her eyes apologize to Miss Payne.

&quot;I&#39;ve got to go,&quot; she says cutting off the beeping on her belt, &quot;Tell you what, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  If you don&#39;t want to wear the uniform you don&#39;t have to.&quot;  A grin bursts out on your face.  You&#39;ve won the battle. She&#39;s going to let you out of here.  &quot;Call maintenance and tell them to come up here, take her robe and then have them escort her from the building.&quot;  The smile teleports off your face and onto Miss Payne&#39;s.

&quot;And don&#39;t worry sweetie,&quot; Miss Daniels says as she walks out the door, &quot;Since it&#39;s your first day I won&#39;t punish you for bothering me...THIS time...&quot; 

Miss Payne grins at you a minute and then picks up the phone.  With a pouty, &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; lower lip, you quickly snatch the plastic package from Miss Payne and finish opening it.  They&#39;re crazy if they think you&#39;re going to let maintenance guys take your robe.  It looks like you have no choice, but to put on the stupid outfit.

You feel like she&#39;s about to pinch your waist in half.

She yanks one more time and you get light headed.  You try to take a deep breath and fail.  Try again and start to panic.  Then a tiny gasp of air gets through.  Then another.  Your heart-rate begins to calm as you realize that you can breathe if you take small, gaspy breaths.  Standing up straight seems to help, but even then you don&#39;t know how she expects you to wear this horrible garment.  You still feel light headed and your midsection aches at the constriction.  You look down at the horrible thing and see that it&#39;s pulled your waist in dramatically.  It makes you look very curvy, emphasizing your rounded &#39;girlish&#39; hips.

&quot;That&#39;ll have to do for now,&quot; she says, &quot;I expect to take another inch out next week, so watch your diet.&quot;

You try to gasp an objection, but Miss Payne ignores your gasping and digs out the next item in the bag.  You shake your head in horror.  This can&#39;t be happening.

She pushes your arms through the straps and fastens it in back.  The lacy red bra adheres to your chest as if it has suction cups in the front.

&quot;This is another M &amp; R patent,&quot; she says turning you around to face her.  She sticks a finger between your skin and the center of the bra.  She fiddles around in there for a moment and you feel a sudden horrible suction on your chest.

&quot;This thing is made for girls like you, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.&quot;

The cups seem to be inflating.  The suction is pushing your chest muscles together into a tiny line of cleavage, even as the expanding cups continue to grow.  You stare up at Miss Payne in horror.  She&#39;s giving you breasts!

&quot;So what do you think?&quot; she asks you, smirking her horrible smirk, &quot;That&#39;s about an A cup.  Want bigger ones?&quot;

You shake your head frantically.  She laughs.

&quot;The guys all like &#39;em big, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  But I&#39;ll let you find that out on your own.&quot;

You stare down at the tiny, but undisguisable breasts jutting off of your chest.  Your chest is bound so tightly that the cleavage line down the center of your chest looks completely natural.

Unable to help yourself, your hands find the new objects that jut out on your chest.  They even feel real.

&quot;Expandable gel,&quot; the horrible woman says in response to your unasked question, &quot;Not much we can do with those tiny titties of yours, but maybe if you&#39;re a good girl, M &amp; R will buy you a bigger, REAL pair.&quot;

You gaze at her in disbelief. Oh GOD! You stand up straight, which helps to alleviate some of the weight your chest now carries.  Your new A-cup breasts jut out in front of you.  Worse the satiny material has caused your nipples to harden. They poke through the front fabric of the material as if trying to cut through it.

&quot;You are gonna be REAL popular, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.&quot;  She chuckles and you feel your blood run cold.


[[Click here to continue.|garter_belt]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="64" name="garter_belt" tags="" position="475,850">You&#39;re still boggling over your new chest as she pulls out a lacy, black garterbelt and wraps it around your waist.  It sits atop your cinched in waist as if it was meant to go there.  The straps dangle against your thighs, with a slightly pleasant, tickly sensation.  Your encased manhood offers another throb and squirt of encouragement.  You feel an increasingly desperate need to go relieve yourself.  How can you be this wet between your legs and not be getting any pleasure from the emission?  You&#39;ve got to get this belt off!

Miss Payne is pulling little half-egg shaped containers out of the plastic bag and setting them on the table.

&quot;I&#39;ll let you choose your stockings.  After all, that&#39;s a very personal decision for a girl.&quot;  You can hear the smugness in her voice.  She&#39;s enjoying this.  She&#39;s getting off on turning you into a prettier and prettier woman.  You dread where this is going.  But there doesn&#39;t seem to be much alternative.

You look at the eggs, trying to figure out which kind of stockings will be the least offensive.

[[Choose the egg marked &#39;Sheer&#39;.|stockings][$stockings = &quot;sheer&quot;]]

You open the egg marked &#39;sheer&#39; and pull out the silky material.

&quot;There are punishments for torn stockings, bitch,&quot; Miss Payne growls behind you, &quot;So I&#39;d be careful if I were you.  Unless you WANT to be punished.&quot;  This causes a shiver up your spine.  You look again at the thin material and think that you possibly made a mistake.  You&#39;re not sure you can put these on, especially with the long, &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; nails.  Beside you, Miss Payne clears her throat. You quickly plop down on a chair and begin to work a stocking up your leg.

Miss Payne gives you an exasperated look.

&quot;Bunch them up and then roll them up your legs, you twit,&quot; she growls.  You start over trying to do what she said and manage to get the silky thing onto your leg.  It takes you a few seconds to figure out how to connect the garter straps, but finally you get the top of stockings secured with the clasp.  The second one goes on quicker.

You stand up, proud of yourself for not having ripped the material.  Miss Payne does not seem impressed.  She just digs through the bag for whatever degrading article of clothing that is next.  You take the opportunity to look down at your legs.

The stockings turn your smooth legs into an amazingly sexy feature.  The material clings to you like a second skin, giving your legs a longer, more sleek look.  The straps on the garter belt are pulled tight against your thighs, emphasizing the femininity that wraps your body.

Then you see the panties that your tormenter has withdrawn from the bag and you silently wish for death.

&quot;What color do you want, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;?&quot; she asks, holding each one up for you to see, &quot;Slutty RED, hot PINK, or BLACK satin?&quot;  She grins at you maliciously as you stare at the thin fragments of fabric in her hands.

You open the egg marked &#39;fishnet&#39; and pull out the crosshatched net.  With any luck, these wouldn&#39;t be as embarrassing as the others.

You had hoped that the fishnets would be the least feminine of the stockings.  You were wrong.  They only add a strange mystique to your long legs.

[[Wear the satin black panties.|panties][$panty_color = &quot;black&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="66" name="panties" tags="" position="725,850">You slide the lacy, &lt;&lt;print $panty_color&gt;&gt; panties up your legs, shivering as the soft material caresses the &lt;&lt;print $stockings&gt;&gt; stockings.  They&#39;re not even fully on, before another pleasureless burst of liquid escapes the chastity belt.  The underwear catches the release and you feel the icky goo soak into the fabric and press against your legs.  At least its not going to drip down your thigh now.

The panties have ruffles around the leg holes, which tickle your inner thighs with every move you make.  The rest of the garment is streamlined, hugging your new curves like a layer of skin.  It covers the infernal chastity belt completely, the back clinging to the crack of your ass as if it were holding on for dear life.

Miss Payne stands back and looks at you, as if she&#39;s appraising a piece of meat.

&quot;You are a knockout, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; she says, &quot;Guys are gonna kill to get into your panties.&quot;

You bow your head in shame.  You have a bad feeling that she&#39;s right.  Even without a mirror, you can tell that your figure is to die for.

&quot;Luckily you&#39;re wearing your panties outside of the garter belt.  That way they&#39;re...easily removable.&quot;

You shiver.  The idea of wearing frilly underwear that&#39;s easy to take off, doesn&#39;t seem to be a reassuring thought right at this moment.

She strides over to you and you shrink away from her, but the room is small that there&#39;s really no where to go.  She presses you up against the locker.  Her body is so tight against you that you can feel the warmth of her skin through her suit.

&quot;You are gonna be one hot bitch,&quot; she says, her face only inches from yours.  One of her hands touches your right breast and then slowly travels down your body untill its between your legs.  Her mouth goes to the side of your face and her lips press against your skin. &quot;You like this, don&#39;t you?&quot; she whispers into your ear.  You shake your head, &quot;Your panties say differently, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  You&#39;re all wet.&quot;

Her middle finger begins to rub your crotch through the silky material.  Her hand slides further between your legs, her fingers finding the back of the belt.  They make tight little circles on the sensitive spot between where your cock is now confined and where your ass begins.  Your whole body tingles.  You arch your back, unable to help yourself. Your new breasts press against hers.

Her finger moves faster between your legs and you&#39;re both horrified and relieved to feel a sexual climax nearing.  Your thighs clamp around her hand, begging her without words to keep going.

&quot;Now tell me the truth,&quot; she whispers, letting her tongue tickle your ear, &quot;Do you like this?&quot;

[[Yes.|cum][$score_sub += 1]]
[[No.|denied][$score_dom += 1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="67" name="cum" tags="" position="850,850">&quot;Yes...&quot; you moan softly.  You&#39;re so close to orgasm that you can feel it in every molecule of your body.

&quot;You like being dressed like this?&quot; she asks.  Her other hand has moved around behind you and is squeezing your left ass cheek, the nails digging almost painfully into your flesh.  You barely notice.  The hand between your legs has your full attention.  The word escapes your lips without a single thought.

&quot;Yes...&quot;

&quot;You like what I&#39;m doing to you&quot; she whispers.  Again you answer, if only to keep her finger moving.

&quot;Yes...&quot;

&quot;You like being a girl, don&#39;t you?&quot;

The orgasm builds to a peak and you moan the word loudly.

&quot;YES!&quot;

Then liquid spurts out onto her finger and into your frilly &lt;&lt;print $panty_color&gt;&gt; panties.  There is no pleasure, no sense of satisfaction. Only a sticky gooey mess.  If anything, you&#39;re hornier now than you were only a minute ago.  Her hand trails out from between your legs with a slimy hairline stream still connected to it.  You want to scream with frustration.  You&#39;re hornier than ever.  That horrible chastity belt denied you any pleasure.  In fact, the orgasm only seemed to intensify your randiness.  You look at Miss Payne with pleading eyes.

&quot;Please...&quot; you whimper &quot;Please take the belt off...&quot;

She puts a finger to your lips, silencing your begging.  She traces your painted lips with the finger and you realize she&#39;s rubbing your own cum on your mouth.  You pull your head away and she laughs.

&quot;You really are a slut, aren&#39;t you?&quot; She pushes away from you and heads back to the table and the dreaded uniform bag.  You wipe your mouth with the back of your hand, but you can still taste the residual saltiness of your own juices on your lips.

&quot;If you&#39;re a good girl, I might let you out of that belt after lunch,&quot; she says pulling a white shirt out of the bag and handing it to you, &quot;If you&#39;re a bad girl, you can wear the thing for a week for all I care.&quot;

The true power this woman has over you suddenly drops into your head like a ton of bricks.  She has the key to your penis.  She can keep you in this thing for as long as she wants to and there isn&#39;t anything you can do about it.  You feel like crying.

You&#39;re so close to orgasm that you can feel it in every molecule of your body and when she pulls her hand away you almost cry out in need.

&quot;Well if you&#39;re going to lie to me...&quot; she walks back to the table.  You&#39;re SO horny you want to scream.  You&#39;ve got to get this chastity belt off.

&quot;Please...&quot; you say, hating the whimper in your voice &quot;Please take the belt off and let me out of here...&quot;

She laughs.

&quot;If you&#39;re a good girl, I might let you out of that belt after lunch,&quot; she says pulling a white shirt out of the bag and handing it to you, &quot;If you&#39;re a bad girl, you can wear the thing for a week for all I care.&quot;

They&#39;re on the wrong side and the nasty long fingernails on your hands keep getting in the way.  Miss Payne watches your struggle with amusement.  The shirt feels too tight, hugging your tiny waist and your new bosom.  The sleeves are too short, showing off your smooth arms.  You&#39;re even further dismayed to see the outline of the red bra visible through the thin white material.

&quot;Now fair warning, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; Miss Payne says as you finish the buttons, &quot;Your supervisor in the secretarial pool has the right to remove one button from your blouse for every major mistake that you make.  Most of you sluts love to show off their tits, but if you want to remain modest...you&#39;d better do what you&#39;re told.&quot;

She has to be joking?  The managers can cut buttons off of your shirt?  Your mind flashes back to Nikki, from downstairs.  Your first thought had been that she was an exhibitionist.  Dear God!  That could be you!

&quot;If you run out of buttons, you&#39;re required to buy a new blouse.  These things cost what you make in a day, so if you&#39;re smart you&#39;ll keep your mouth shut unless a manager finds a reason for you to open it.&quot;

You cringe at the crude innuendo of that statement.


[[Click here to continue.|skirt]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="70" name="skirt" tags="" position="1225,850">You&#39;re so wrapped up in thought that the skirt almost hits you in the face.  You catch it out of the air at the last minute and worm your way into it.  It barely fits over your hips, but zips easily up your cinched waist.  The pleated bottom twirls around your stocking-covered legs, caressing them with your every breath.

Miss Payne instructs you to tuck the blouse in and you do so quickly.  The threat of button removal and the promise of getting out of the horrible chastity belt has you as meek as a mouse.  The blouse presses ever tighter against your breasts now that its tucked in.  You look down at them and see the writing that hugs the curve of your left chest.

&quot;&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;:  How may I make your day better?&quot;

You have a feeling that just looking like you do could make some guys have a better day.  The thought frightens you almost as much as the objects Miss Payne holds in her hands.

[[Click here to continue.|shoes]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="71" name="shoes" tags="" position="100,975">She&#39;s got to be kidding!  How does she expect you to walk in those things?

You sit back down and cram your feet into the constricting, black footwear, your toes screaming as they compress into the pointed tip. The heel looks to be about two inches high, but is so slender you wonder how you&#39;re going to stand up.  The straps around your ankle end in a small clasp that you fiddle with until you finally get them strapped on. You marvel at how small they make your feet look.  Then again with how uncomfortable they are, you&#39;re not THAT suprised.  They feel two sizes too small.

&quot;Stand up,&quot; Miss Payne barks and you wobble to your feet.  She kneels in front of you and before you realize what she&#39;s up to, she fastens a tiny silver padlock to the clasp on your right ankle.  She grabs your right foot before you can pull it away and puts a similar lock on that one.  She stands up and looks at you approvingly.

&quot;Sluts like you need to keep your fuck-me shoes on at all times,&quot; she cackles, &quot;After you learn to walk in these, we&#39;ll get you a higher heel.  Maybe then you can look me in the eye.&quot;  She laughs again and you realize you&#39;re still shorter than her even in the heels.  Your knees feel weak and you take a tentative step and almost fall over.  How are you going to walk anywhere in these?  And when is she going to let you take them off?


[[Click here to continue.|collar]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="72" name="collar" tags="" position="225,975">While you wobble around trying to get your &#39;sea legs&#39;, Miss Payne pulls a final item out of the bag.  She fastens the tiny lace collar with the heart pendant around your neck.  It constricts around your neck just short of painfully and when you clear your throat it comes out higher and softer than your regular voice.  You look at Miss Payne miserably.

&quot;There,&quot; she says, pressing a finger to the tiny heart on your neck, &quot;That ought to hide the last remnant of maleness from everybody. And this...&quot; she uses her fingernail to click a small button on the heart.  The thing begins to vibrate ever so slightly against your neck. &quot;That will help you sound just a little more breathless.  Congratulations, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;, you make one hell of a fine looking secretary.&quot;

This does not make you feel good.  You shift uncomfortably from one leg to another in the constricting shoes, feeling the panty ruffles tickle your thighs.  You wish you could go back in time and stop yourself from ever coming to this hellish place.

&quot;Ready to start your training, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;?&quot;  She uses that horrible name again and you realize that you&#39;re starting to automatically respond it.

&quot;If you need to go to the bathroom, go now!&quot; she commands, picking up the phone off the wall and punching in a number.

[[Go to the bathroom.|bathroom]]
[[You don&#39;t need to go.|waiting]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="73" name="bathroom" tags="" position="350,975">As you carefully wobble your way to the bathroom, you realize that you actually DO have to go.  But the main reason for the trip to the water closet is so you can catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror.  Despite the horror of your situation, you&#39;re morbidly curious about what you look like.  Each step you take causes your clothing and hair to swish and rub against your sensitive skin, but its impossible to tell how you actually look without a mirror.

As the door closes to the bathroom, conditioning kicks in and you have to rush to the stall.  There&#39;s a moment of panic as you reach for your dick underneath your skirt and realize that it isn&#39;t there. Then you remember the chastity belt.  How are you supposed to pee?  You feel down in between your legs and find the tiny hole Miss Payne had rubbed between your legs.  So you CAN pee, but you have to sit down to do it.  With a fresh wash of embarrassment, you pull the tight &lt;&lt;print $panty_color&gt;&gt; panties down to your ankles and sit on the toilet, letting the liquid flow out of your crotch in a manner consistent with the opposite sex.

You wonder briefly about the other type of bathroom function.  With very little effort, you manage to pull the strap running up your ass crack to one side.  It looks like this belt was designed to let you have full bathroom capabilities.  At least that&#39;s something.  You can feel the residual moisture inside the belt and dab at it with toilet paper mortified at having to wipe yourself like a girl.  You take the opportunity to mop your panties out as well, getting the soaking fabric as dry as possible.

You step out of the stall and see the stunning woman in the mirror above the sink.  For a moment you think this woman is someone who has come in to pee.  Then the realization strikes.  Its YOU!

Part of you was afraid that the image in the mirror would reflect a man dressed up in women&#39;s clothing.  What you see is almost worse.  Looking back at you is a sexy woman dressed in one of the most provocative outfits imaginable.  Your member strains against the unyielding chastity belt at the sight of this goddess. Your mind starts running through perverse acts of what you want to do to this woman, while at the same time cringing at the thought of having those things done to YOU!

Your long, slender legs seem endless in the &lt;&lt;print $stockings&gt;&gt; stockings, before they tuck their way into the swishy black skirt.  You turn slightly and the hemline swirls up to reveal the garter straps and the barest glimpse of exposed thigh.  There&#39;s another sharp pain inside the belt as the woman in the mirror puts on this show for you.

Your waist is impossibly tapered and, looking at your figure, you&#39;re not surprised at all that you can barely breathe.  Small, perfectly formed orbs strain at the thin material of your shirt as if they want release from the cotton restraints.  The bra holding them back doesn&#39;t even attempt to hide behind the white material covering it.

Another throb inside the belt.

The writing on your chest causes the pretty girl in the mirror to blush as she reads it.  This woman looks like she has hundreds of tricks to make someone&#39;s day better.

The girl strikes another pose and you&#39;re amazed as the vision in front of you mimics your every action.  You feel the soft caress of the &lt;&lt;print $stockings&gt;&gt; stockings as your legs move against each other.  Without warning, a tiny dribble of liquid squirts into your panties.  You don&#39;t think you&#39;ve ever been hornier in your life.  The desperate look of need in the face of the &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; haired girl in the mirror only makes your horniness worse.  The girl looks like she&#39;s in heat.  A horny slut willing to do anything for sex.  Her face is flushed.  Her pupils dialated.  This is a desperate woman.  You shiver as gooseflesh pimples your flesh.  Any guy that sees you is going to be all over you.  Despite your growing horror, your member shoots another worthless spurt.

You go back to the stall and wipe the creamy liquid out of the &lt;&lt;print $panty_color&gt;&gt; panties again.  A huge wash of dismay sweeps over you.  Seeing yourself dressed like this has gotten you incredibly turned on, despite the shame and humiliation you feel of being so easily made up to look like a woman.  You want, or rather you NEED desperately, to relieve yourself...to get rid of this sexual tension.  The last thing you want people to think is that you ENJOY looking like this.  You try to work a finger up inside of the chastity belt, but the thing keeps your probing feminine finger at bay.  You try rubbing yourself through it.  You&#39;re rewarded with a slight tingling and another squirt of liquid that comes out with absolutely no pleasure.  You feel like screaming in frustration.

You stand up and pull the panties back into place, the tickling frills of the lace on your thighs causing you to instantly squirt another shot into them.  Still no pleasure.  No release.  You stamp your foot allowing yourself a tiny tantrum at the uncomfort of this situation.  Every move you make seems to cause your trapped member to want to spit in protest and there doesn&#39;t seem to be anything you can do about it.  How are you going to get through the day when everything you do causes your panties to get damper and damper.  For a moment the idea crosses your mind to ask Miss Payne to undo your belt so you can relieve yourself.  Then the notion of explaining why you need to remove the belt to her flashes through your head and you instantly abandon the idea.  You definately don&#39;t want her thinking you like looking like this.

&quot;What&#39;s going on in there?&quot; the horrible woman hollers in to you, &quot;Hurry up.  I don&#39;t have all day!&quot;

[[Click here to continue.|hallway2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="74" name="waiting" tags="" position="475,975">&quot;Fine,&quot; she says, &quot;Sit down and keep quiet for a minute.  I need to call Personnel and see who to take you to for training.&quot;

Training.  You don&#39;t like the sound of that. Logically you understand the need to go through the basics, but how hard can the data processing job be?  You sit and type.  What else is there?

You sit down at the break table, uncomfortably aware of having to watch how you sit.  The last thing you want is to showcase your exposed thighs, or worse, your new &lt;&lt;print $panty_color&gt;&gt; panties.  You sit with your knees together and notice again how incredibly sexy the &lt;&lt;print $stockings&gt;&gt; stockings have made your legs.  On impulse you cross one over the other allowing them to rub together slightly.  You feel your bare, smooth skin above the stockings rub together and the ruffled panties tickling your crotch.  A tingle runs through you.  Your chastity belt begins to hurt as blood rushes down to your equipment and finds it has no where to go.  The back strap of the chastity belt, combined with the new underwear has given you an incredibly uncomfortable wedgie.  Making sure that Miss Payne isn&#39;t looking, you work a hand down the back of your skirt and pull out the intruding material.  The strap from the chastity belt pulls out easily enough.  Hell you could even use the bathroom without worry, but as soon as you release it, it snaps right back into your crack.  The panties only further agitate the problem and barely cover the strap running through your cheeks.  You shift uncomfortably, crossing your legs the other direction.  The skirt caresses your sensitive skin as it moves, which only further aggravates your condition.  Your face begins to flush and you realize with a huge wash of humiliation that you&#39;ve gotten yourself horribly turned on.

Without warning, a tiny spurt of liquid shoots into your panties, but because of the constricting chastity belt you feel no pleasure.  Only a gooey, sticky sensation as the panties absorb your liquid excitement.  You squirm in your seat as the clothing continues to stimulate your body.  More restraining uncomfort from the belt...and more goo.

The true malevolence of the chastity belt slams itself home in your mind.  You feel an uncontrollable need to go to the bathroom and relieve yourself of sexual tension, despite the humiliation you would feel at acting on this base animal impulse, especially while you&#39;re at work.  But you know, with a dawning certainty that the chastity belt locked around your equipment won&#39;t permit you any pleasure.  As if to confirm this, your tucked away equipment issues another tiny spurt of cream into your panties.  How are you going to get through the day with this perpetual distraction?  You never imagined that dressing up this way could be so erotically frustrating.

Miss Payne seems oblivious to your discomfort, talking into the phone and twirling the cord around one of her fingers.  She barks questions to whoever she is talking to, completely unaware that the breathless, new employee behind her would sell his soul for ten minutes of privacy without the chastity belt on.  She hangs up the phone.

&quot;Well?&quot; she asks looking at you, &quot;Get up.  We&#39;re not paying you to sit around on your lazy ass all day!&quot;  You jump to attention, nearly twisting your ankle in the horrible shoes.

[[Click here to continue.|hallway2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="75" name="hallway2" tags="" position="600,975">&quot;C&#39;mon,&quot; Miss Payne says, practically pushing you out the door into the hallway.  You shudder with fear as it dawns on you that other people are going to see you now.  And not just women.  Men are going to see you dressed like a teenage boy&#39;s wet dream.  Your legs get even more wobbily then they were.

&quot;Move your ass back and forth more,&quot; she mutters behind you, &quot;It helps with the balance.&quot;  Desperate to not fall on your ass, you move it back and forth as she suggested.  It helps a little, even as it emphasizes the material riding up your ass cheeks.  As you move you have to move your hands differently as you walk in order to keep your balance.  You feel like a caricature of a woman.  A cartoon sex drawing like Jessica Rabbit or Betty Boop.

Miss Payne leads you down to hall to the elevator.  With every step you take, the lacy panties tickle your crotch.  The wetness down there only further humiliates you, yet as the skirt swishes across your silky legs they grow damper still.  You&#39;re finding it really hard to focus on anything other than the erotic stimulation this outfit is inflicting on you.

She swipes her card and the elevator arrives promptly.  You step inside, but Miss Payne doesn&#39;t.  She just leans in, swipes her card and presses the 12 button.  Then she leans back out of the elevator.

&quot;Enjoy your training, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; she says as the elevator doors begin to slide shut, &quot;I expect an obedient little girl after lunch.&quot;

Then she&#39;s gone and you&#39;re left alone in an elevator that is rocketing upward.

It doesn&#39;t get to twelve before it stops.

The man who steps into the elevator causes your heart to go so fast that it feels like it&#39;s going to burst.  He is a good four inches taller than you and must weigh at least 70 or 80 pounds more.  Not that he&#39;s overweight.  His muscles practically rip through his suit, the power tie barely containing his tree-trunk neck.  You quickly look down, afraid to make eye contact with him.  What if he says something to you?

He gets into the elevator and gives you the once over while he fishes for his keycard in his pocket.  You stand awkwardly, not exactly sure what to do with your hands.  He chuckles under his breath at your obvious discomfort.

&quot;First day, huh?&quot; he says still rooting in his pocket for the key.  You mumble assent, aware that your voice seems even higher due to the blasted vibrating collar.  The guy doesn&#39;t seem to notice anything unusual about you at all.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, cutie,&quot; he says as he finds the elusive plastic card, &quot;With a body like yours, you got nothing to worry about around here.&quot;

Did he just call you cutie?  Your stalled heart offers a double beat of panic.  He likes your body.  Oh God!

He swipes the card and the doors begin to slide shut.  He sidles up next to you, invading your personal space and panic turns to fear which turns to terror.  You step away, but in the closed elevator there&#39;s no where to go.

He runs his fingers through your hair, inspecting it, while you tremble like a little girl.

&quot;Love that &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; hair,&quot; he mutters and then yanks it so your head is pulled side ways.  You cry out in pain, but he ignores you continuing his examination as if you were a car he was thinking of renting.

With the hand not holding your hair, he grabs your face and puckers your mouth.  He peers in at your teeth, nodding with approval.

&quot;Good teeth, nice eyes...&quot;

He grabs your left breast.

&quot;Small up top, but that&#39;s easily fixable.&quot;  He spins you around effortlessly.  You&#39;re so taken off guard you don&#39;t even have time to resist.  You struggle to maintain your balance even as his hand grabs your ass.  You jump in surprise and he laughs.

&quot;And you&#39;re obviously still fresh.  The girls around here get jaded so quick...And that &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; hair...you&#39;d be surprised how many clients ask for that...&quot;

What the hell is he talking about?  And why is he treating you like a piece of meat.

The elevator dings and still he keeps you pressed to the wall of the car, examining your ass and legs with a keen eye.

&quot;All right, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; he says reading the name off of your breast, &quot;You tell your supervisor that Mister Elliot is interested.  Got it?&quot;  You nod, grateful that he&#39;s moved away from you a little.  You don&#39;t know what that was all about, but you&#39;re ready to be off this elevator.  You smile a polite smile at him, and then hurry for the door, wiggling your butt back and forth as you go to keep your balance.  The door shuts behind you and you breath a sigh of relief.  The brute just sexually harassed you!  What kind of place is this!?!

Your thoughts are cut short as you see the girl standing in front of you.

She&#39;s dressed almost identically to the outfit you&#39;re in.  Her pale skin shimmers next to her white shirt.  Her hair is blonde and razor-straight, tucked behind her ear in a way that emphasizes her cuteness.  She looks at you and smirks at the bewildered look on your face.  You feel a wave of dislike wash over you towards this girl, even as your eyes continue to take in her beauty.

&quot;Are you &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;?&quot; she asks, her voice small and almost non-existent.

Your legs are shaking and it&#39;s only partly because of the heels.

The woman who steps into the elevator isn&#39;t dressed anything like you.  She wears a smart looking suit, with a skirt that goes down to her calves.  You wish, for a brief moment, that you could have had an outfit like hers instead of the tarty thing you&#39;re in now.  Then you decide that if you&#39;re going to be wishing, you might as well wish not to be dressed like a woman at all.

It&#39;s scary how easily that name trips off your tongue now.  You grind your teeth.  You can&#39;t wait to get out of this place.  Once again it occurs to you, that your voice is way too high and girlie.  It shouldn&#39;t have been this easy for them to turn you into this.  You&#39;re a guy, for chrissake.

&quot;Follow me,&quot; the girl in front of you says.  Her voice is barely audible and she hurries down the hallway not looking back to see if you&#39;re coming.  You race after her, almost twisting your ankle in the blasted shoes, trying to keep up.  She gets to the destination door, puts her hand on the knob, but doesn&#39;t open it until you get there.

&quot;Good luck, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; she says softly.  You look at the name stenciled on her shirt.

When she sees the coast is clear she says, &quot;Follow me.&quot; Her voice is barely audible and she hurries down the hallway not looking back to see if you&#39;re coming.

The room is small and instantly makes you feel claustrophobic.  There are five tiny desks with chairs, each one with an antique looking manual typewriter on top of it.  Becky instantly rushes toward the one on the end and begins typing frantically as if her life depended on it.  Your eyes drift toward the front of the room and you see a man in a suit, sitting behind his desk looking at you with intense blue eyes.  It is not a pleasant look.  You shiver at the idea of being dressed this way in front of a man like this.  You feel naked.  Worse than naked.

&quot;Well?&quot; he growls at you.  You jump at his voice.  &quot;Choose a desk and sit down, girl...We&#39;re not paying you to stand there idle.&quot;  You&#39;re beginning to understand Becky&#39;s nervousness.  You&#39;ve been in the room maybe three seconds and just the presence of this man has you on edge.

You dash to a desk and sit down.  The chair is horribly uncomfortable.  It&#39;s too low and the seat feels like it has a ridge down the center that pushes your underwear further into your ass.  Sitting here is like giving yourself a perpetual wedgie.  Worse is the pebbled texture of the seat which seems to cling to your skirt pulling it up as you sit.  You yank the garment back down, embarrassed by the glimpse of thigh that you just showed the man in the suit.  The gleam in his eye says he not only noticed, but approved of the indecency.

He walks over beside you and stands a little too close.  You turn to look at him and realize that the low seat puts you eye level with his crotch.  You quickly turn back away, face flushed.

&quot;So you&#39;re &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; he says looming beside you, &quot;Miss Payne says you&#39;re gonna be a pain in the ass.  You better hope she&#39;s misjudged you.&quot;  He puts a hand on your shoulder and leans down so his face is beside yours.  You cringe away from his touch.  &quot;Let me tell you something, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  Don&#39;t mess with me.  I have a very short temper and if you cause me any grief you&#39;re gonna have a lot bigger problem than a few buttons missing on your shirt.  Isn&#39;t that right, Becky?&quot;

From across the room, Becky says quickly and clearly, &quot;Yes, Mr. Kail.&quot; He turns back to you.

&quot;Becky&#39;s a lazy slut, but she knows when to speak and when to keep her trap shut!  Do you understand what I&#39;m saying to you, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;?&quot;


[[Nod your head.|nod][$score_sub += 1]]

With a lightning fast yank, Mr. Kail pulls on your hair, causing your head to go back. He holds you there, staring directly up into his burning blue eyes.

&quot;When I ask you a question bitch, I expect an answer,&quot; he growls, &quot;Not a nod, or a grunt or a mumble...do you hear me slut?&quot;

He releases your head and waits for an answer.

He smiles, one of his hands caressing your cheek with the backs of his fingers.  You try not to flinch away from the touch, but you can&#39;t help it.  His thumb traces your lower lip before the hand moves away.  You shudder.  Just his touch has made you feel violated somehow.

&quot;Good girl,&quot; he says as if you were an obedient dog, &quot;All right.  Put a sheet of paper in your machine and type the following paragraph.&quot;

You scramble with the paper next to the typewriter.  The nails that jut out from the end of your fingers keep you from being able to grab one of the sheets and he begins talking before you even have the machine ready.  You curse internally, wondering why a high tech company like this isn&#39;t using word processors.  Maybe you&#39;ll get to use one of those after you finish your training.

&quot;Hurry up girl.  Paragraph One.  My name is &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  New line.&quot; You type in the words, dismayed at how slow you have to go because of the &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; talons on your fingers. You&#39;re only half finished with the sentence when he starts the next one.

&quot;I am an air-headed secretary.  I don&#39;t think.  I do what I&#39;m told.  New line.&quot;  You frantically try to catch up, your mind racing as the words slowly appear on the page in front of you.  What kind of training is this?  The nails keep you from going fast enough and he starts the next paragraph before you finish the one you&#39;re on.

&quot;I don&#39;t ask questions.  I don&#39;t complain. My mouth is not for speaking. New line.&quot;  You type the sentences as fast as you can, wincing as your long nails cause you to type &#39;complain&#39; as &#39;cfomplain&#39;.  You&#39;re not completely sure you got the sentences in the right order.  Why is he going this fast?  Can&#39;t he see that you&#39;re having trouble?  

&quot;I am seen, not heard.  I like to be seen.  I like to look sexy.   New paragraph.&quot;

With a quick confused glance at Mr. Kail, you type it in, trying to remember it long enough to get it onto the paper.  Your eyes scan back over the paragraph.  This has to be a joke!  Some sort of office prank.  What kind of training is this?

&quot;Those are your rules to learn this morning, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  I want that paragraph typed on twenty five pages, eight to a page.  Got it?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Mr. Kail,&quot; you say, your voice already sounding recorded. You hit the Enter button twice to cue up the next paragraph.  You hope you&#39;ve transcribed it right.  This is not the kind of man you want to have angry at you!

You wonder if she has the same assignment. 

You finish the sentence.  This is the dumbest training exercise you&#39;ve ever had.  These sentences are barely above an elementary school primer and they&#39;re horribly demeaning.  What exactly does this brute want you to learn by doing this?

Another typo.  These blasted nails. You&#39;ll have to go slower.

You shift in the uncomfortable seat, trying to manuever the chastity belt and the frilly underwear out of your butt crack.  You don&#39;t succeed.  The tickling ruffles of your panties do manage to summon another throb from your encased cock though.

God this seat is uncomfortable.  You shift again, and the rough texture underneath you causes your skirt to ride back up.  You look down and see a peek of thigh in your lap and try to shift again to get it to disappear.  You only succeed in working your skirt up further.

This is unbearable.

You stop typing and pull your skirt back down. 

&quot;Is there a problem, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;?&quot; Mr. Kail asks in the most condescending voice imaginable, &quot;I told you to type, not to play with your outfit.  If you take those hands off of the keys again before you&#39;re finished, I&#39;ll make sure you don&#39;t HAVE an outfit to play with.&quot;

You squeak with fear.  He wouldn&#39;t dare try to undress you.  Would he? 

Best not to take any chances.  Your hands fly back up to the keys and to the fourth sentence.

There.  One paragraph done.  This isn&#39;t that hard.  If only the seat wasn&#39;t SO uncomfortable.  You type the paragraph again.  Then again.  By the fifth page it&#39;s ingrained in your memory.  By the tenth, you know them by heart.

Your skirt has ridden up again, but Mr. Kail&#39;s threat wins out over your instinct to correct it.  Every second that ticks by makes you aware of the ridge in the center of the seat.  It feels like the chair has a line in it that actually contours to the curve of your ass.  It&#39;s like they want you to be uncomfortable.  You wiggle around unable to help yourself, wincing as your skirt rides further up and the ridge climbs further between your ass cheeks.  There is more than just a glimpse of your thigh showing now.  Your eyes flash over to where Mr. Kail is sitting, and the leer he is giving you proves that he has noticed your skirt problems.  You shiver.  He&#39;s checking you out!

Halfway through page eighteen, Becky stops typing and raises one hand up in the air as if she was in elementary school.  She looks up hopefully at Mr. Kail.  He lets her sit there for a minute before saying, &quot;All done, Becky?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Mr. Kail.&quot;  Her voice singsongs the words.

&quot;Bring them up here and let me see.&quot; he barks.  Becky springs to her feet and minces up to Mr. Kail&#39;s desk.  You can&#39;t help but watch her ass sway back and forth as she goes.  The way those heels make her walk makes your mouth water.  Then you remember that you have to walk that same way and another cold chill runs up your spine.

You continue to type, but your eyes are on Becky as she reaches Mr. Kail&#39;s desk.  He pats his legs with his hand and you can barely contain your surprise as she sits across his lap.  This place is insane!  One of his hands rests on the small of her back, while the other is on her knee.  She holds the papers at a good reading level for him and he peruses the first page. 

&quot;Say your lesson, Becky,&quot; he says.  The hand on her leg moves upward slightly to rest just above the knee.  Becky recites the words she has typed without looking at them.

&quot;My name is Becky.

I do what I&#39;m told.  I don&#39;t know what is best.  I need to be corrected. 

I&#39;m here to serve.  I live to please.  I love to give.

I need to be watched.  I like to be touched.  I love to be used.&quot; 

You may have imagined it, but you think you hear a slight quiver in her voice on those last words, her eyes wet with moisture. You look down at the words you&#39;re typing and realize the similarity.  You&#39;ve memorized yours as well.  You&#39;ve typed these stupid simple sentences so many times that you don&#39;t even have to look back to know what comes next.  They are training you!  They&#39;re training you to become more and more like Becky.  Docile.  Obedient.  Submissive.

Mr. Kail seems pleased.  The hand on her back pats her ass affectionately while the hand on her leg seems to have disappeared under the hem of her skirt.  This man is a sexual PIG!  Becky squirms as his hand nears her crotch but she makes no effort to get off of his lap.

&quot;Good job, Becky, only eight typos.&quot;  His voice is filled with good cheer. &quot;I think this might be your last week of training.&quot;  Her eyes gleam with hope. &quot;How many weeks have you been training with me, Becky?  You may speak.&quot;

Her answer is clear and concise, &quot;Five!&quot;

Five weeks! Five weeks of doing these stupid exercises with the pig every morning?  You&#39;re going to go insane.

He smacks her ass hard enough to make her squeal and jump off of his lap.  He jots a quick note on a piece of paper and hands it to her. 

&quot;I&#39;ll let you go get the three of us lunch today, Becky.  You&#39;ve earned a little freedom I&#39;d say.&quot;  Excitement fills her eyes.  The poor girl must have such a boring life to get excited over taking a lunch order.  &quot;I&#39;ll have my usual. You and &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt; will have salads.  Get going girl!&quot; He smacks her on the ass again.  She scuttles from the room and disappears out the door and down the hall.

His eyes fall on you and you quickly turn your attention back to your typing.

&quot;&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; he growls, &quot;Bring the pages you have finished up to me right now!&quot;

Flustered, you grab the pages and quickly wobble your way to the front.  He pats his legs the same as he did for Becky.  He can&#39;t be serious?  He wants you to sit on his lap!?!

Your skirt bunches up again, riding up high enough to show off your &lt;&lt;print $panty_color&gt;&gt; underwear.  You squirm trying to fix it but his hand clamps down on your knee, chilling you into stillness.  The heat from his hand radiates through the stocking.  You feel his other hand on your back, equally warm through the thin material of your blouse.  Your arm goes around his neck for balance which unfortunately makes you press your body against his.  You can smell his cologne, a husky man smell that contrasts sharply to the fruity odor that emanates from your freshly exfoliated skin.  He&#39;s so much bigger than you that you feel completely overwhelmed by his bulk.

A sudden thought occurs to you.  Miss Payne talked to him about you, but did she mention that you&#39;re actually a guy?  You wonder if he knows.  You&#39;re mentally torn as to whether you want him to know the truth or not.  On one hand, if he knows you&#39;re a guy, he has still insisted that you sit on his lap.  At the same time, if he doesn&#39;t know and then finds out, you could be in serious trouble.  You don&#39;t think this is a man who likes surprises.  You begin to shiver with your predicament and the hand on your knee squeezes gently.

&quot;You&#39;re doing well, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.&quot; he says, his voice soft and surprisingly sweet, &quot;I&#39;m only mean to you if you do something bad.  When you&#39;re a good girl, you have nothing to worry about.&quot;  The hand on your leg begins to move back and forth slowly...soothingly.  You don&#39;t like the way this is going, yet at the same time, the soft stroking on your leg causes another tiny squirt of liquid to fill your panties.

&quot;Now let&#39;s see your papers,&quot; he says, his tone jovial.  You hold them up for him, much as Becky did, and await his response.

[[Click here to continue.|bad_grades]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="88" name="no_sit" tags="" position="975,1100">You shake your head.  This has gone more than far enough.  They may have dressed you up like a slut, but you draw the line at sitting on a man&#39;s lap.  You hold out your pages to him.  If he wants to read them he can do it with you standing right here.

He doesn&#39;t move to take the pages.  He just stares at you for a long minute with a quizzical expression as if he&#39;s trying to figure you out.

&quot;&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; he says with a calm, teacher-like quality.  &quot;When a manager pats their legs like this...&quot;

He demonstrates the gesture again.

&quot;...that means you&#39;re to go sit across their lap.&quot;  Without warning, he grabs your arm and pulls you down across his lap.  You squeal in alarm as he positions you appropriately across his legs.  Your skirt bunches up and you know that those stupid &lt;&lt;print $panty_color&gt;&gt; panties are visible to this brute.  One of his hands clamps down on your leg, while the other loops around behind your back, holding you in his clutches.

&quot;Put your arm around my neck...&quot; he doesn&#39;t give you time to comply.  Instead he tilts you backward and you grab out with your arm putting it exactly where he wants it.  The hand on your leg squeezes and then slides upward, stopping with his thumb touching bare skin.  You shiver at your vulnerability, thanking your lucky stars that you&#39;re equipment is locked safely away from discovery. You can&#39;t imagine what this beast would do if he found out he had a guy sitting on his lap!

Then without warning he slaps your ass so hard that you squeal and jump off of him.  You turn around, face red with fury and embarrassment.  His calm expression hasn&#39;t changed.

&quot;Now that you understand what is expected, let&#39;s try it again.&quot;  He pats his legs.

[[Sit on his lap.|sit_on_lap][$score_sub += 1]]
[[Refuse.|no_sit2][$score_dom += 1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="89" name="no_sit2" tags="" position="1100,1100">You shake your head again.

&quot;Mr. Kail...I really don&#39;t think...&quot; You don&#39;t get any further.  The calm expression instantly falls away from his face.  One second he&#39;s sitting behind his desk, the next he is on his feet looming over you.

&quot;Payne was right.  You&#39;re a stupid little bitch.&quot; He grabs your wrist with one hand, while the other one digs through a drawer of his desk.  You try to pull away, but his grip is like a vice.  Then you see what he pulls out of the desk and you squirm against his grip with all your might.  You don&#39;t succeed.

The click of the handcuff around your wrist resonates in your head like a slamming door.  He yanks you to the ground with the empty cuff and then fastens it to the leg of his chair.  Tears start to sting your eyes.  The cuff is hurting your wrist and you&#39;re trapped at the feet of this horrible man.  You look up at him in pain and fear.  He smiles at you and plops down in the chair.  With one fluid movement he lifts his legs and places them on your back, forcing you onto all fours.  Your cuffed wrist doesn&#39;t let you get far enough away to get his legs off of you.  You squirm under the weight, trying to get the cuff off or to get away from the chair.  There&#39;s nothing you can do.

&quot;All right, slut.&quot; he says, the calm voice back again, &quot;Here&#39;s what you did wrong.&quot;

&quot;First of all, you refused to sit on my lap.  I forgave it the first time since you didn&#39;t know the rules.  But after I explained it, you still said no.  You NEVER say &#39;NO&#39; to a manager, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  NEVER!&quot;

You whimper as he crosses his legs on your back.  God they&#39;re heavy!

&quot;Second of all, you spoke without permission.  You&#39;re not paid to speak.  You&#39;re not paid to think.  You&#39;re paid to do what you&#39;re told!  Is that understood?&quot;

He kicks you softly with a leg and you realize you were just asked a question.

&quot;Yes, Mr. Kail,&quot; you say, your voice miserable with despair.  How can they treat you like this?  You&#39;ve got to get out of here!

&quot;Now, are you going to be a good girl and sit on my lap when I tell you to?&quot; he asks.  Your back is starting to ache from the weight.

&quot;Yes, Mr. Kail,&quot; you say.  What choice do you have?  Sit on his lap or stay as a handcuffed footstool.  It really seems like a lose/lose situation any way you look at it.  But at least on his lap you won&#39;t be in pain.

He seems pleased with your submission.  He lifts his legs and puts one on either side of you.  You&#39;re so grateful for the lack of weight on top of you that you don&#39;t immediately realize the position that you&#39;re in.

&quot;Come here,&quot; he says beckoning you towards him.  It suddenly occurs to you that you&#39;re kneeling between his legs.  Worse he wants you to get closer to him.  Your hesitation costs you and he kicks you with his foot.  You instantly squirm closer, raising yourself up as much as the handcuff will allow.  He kicks you again and you squeal.  You squirm closer, crawling on your knees. His legs are touching each of your arms, your  stomach pressed hard against his crotch.  Something long and hard throbs against you and you flinch away, but his legs clamp around you and you find yourself trapped...kneeling in front of this horrible man.  He rubs your neck with his strong fingers as if he&#39;s rewarding you.

&quot;That&#39;s better,&quot; he chuckles and pats your head.  He&#39;s treating you like a pet.  Punishing bad behavior and condescendingly rewarding the good.  You&#39;ve never been more humiliated in all your life.  The thing pulsing against your stomach grows bigger.  You can&#39;t believe that you&#39;re in this situation.  How have you ended up as a sexy woman, forced to kneel in front of a sexual deviant?

He caresses your face one more time and then leans his chair back and lets you slip the cuff off the chair leg.  Thankfully, his legs open and you can scramble to your feet.  You seriously contemplate running away.  But you know, without a doubt, that it wouldn&#39;t work.  You don&#39;t have a card for the elevator and even if you did, you doubt that you could make it that far in these horrible heels before the brute caught you.

He produces a tiny key with a flourish worthy of a magician and the handcuff falls from your wrist into his hand.  You massage the tender spot on your skin where the metal dug into it. You have GOT to get out of this place.

He pats his legs.  Oh god!  You still have to sit on his lap.  Your eyes fall to his crotch and the bulge there causes your blood to run cold.

You wait so long that his brow furrows and he starts to get up.  You yelp and instantly throw yourself onto him.

&quot;This can&#39;t be happening,&quot; you think as you find yourself sitting awkwardly across his lap.  Your skirt bunches up again, riding up high enough to show off your &lt;&lt;print $panty_color&gt;&gt; underwear.

His hand continues to stroke your stocking-clad leg. &quot;The first sentence is good.  At least you&#39;re smart enough to know your name.&quot;  He smiles at you, as if this is a compliment.

 &lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt;if $line1 == &quot;line1_good&quot;&gt;&gt;
&quot;The second line is all in order.  Good.  So you CAN do what you&#39;re told.&quot; His hand squeezes your leg affectionately.  You squirm from the near ticklish grip and he chuckles.
    &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
&quot;No, no, no,&quot; he says, his voice once again reverting to the master scolding a pet, &quot;You&#39;ve got the second line all screwed up.  Every time too.  Stupid Bitch!   That&#39;s ten points off.&quot;  You don&#39;t like the sound of that.&quot;;
    &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt;if $line2 == &quot;line2_good&quot;&gt;&gt;
&quot;The third line looks pretty good.  We&#39;ll have to see if you&#39;ve actually learned this lesson.  You look like you have quite a few complaints in that pretty mouth of yours.  No worries though, we&#39;ll soon fill it up with something else.&quot;  The hand on your leg moves up to caress your face for a moment.  Again, his thumb traces your lip.  This time it actually slips in between them for a second before the hand returns to your thigh.  You feel sick.  The hand on your back slowly slides down to your ass and pats it playfully.  This may be the most uncomfortable situation you&#39;ve ever been in.
    &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
&quot;What is this?  You really are a stupid airhead aren&#39;t you,&quot; he asks, not expecting an answer.  &quot;You&#39;ve got the third line all messed up.  I can&#39;t forgive this.  Your score is ten points lower.&quot;  He &#39;tsks&#39; under his breath, the hand on your back sliding down to your ass and smacking it pertly.  You &#39;Yip&#39; in surprise and he chuckles at your discomfort, his hand staying on your ass.
    &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;nobr&gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt;if $line3 == &quot;line3_good&quot;&gt;&gt;
&quot;The fourth line is perfect.&quot;  The hand on your butt squeezes and you wriggle uncomfortably.  This can&#39;t be legal.  You can&#39;t treat people this way and get away with it.
    &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
&quot;The fourth line is all mixed up.&quot;  He looks at you for a second, a gleam forming in his eye, &quot;Since it&#39;s your first day, and since you REALLY are a good-looking bitch, I&#39;m going to stick to taking off ten points for this crap.&quot;  The hand on your ass, squeezes and you squirm on his lap.  Then a thought occurs to you.  He thinks you&#39;re good-looking and you&#39;re wiggling around on his lap.  You know the reaction a woman dressed like you are would cause if she wiggled around on your lap!  Fear causes your body to lock up. Oh God!
    &lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&gt;

&quot;These really aren&#39;t bad for your first day, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; the brute says, patting your leg.  The final pat lands his hand a little further up your leg.  You shiver, unable to help yourself.  You are all too aware of what you look like, right now.  The last thing that you need is to be on the lap of a sex-obsessed man!

&quot;Say your lesson, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; he says.  His hand is on your bare thigh now.  Oh god, you can feel the throbbing beast beneath you.  Without thinking you spout off the sentences you typed over and over.  They come out perfectly and you weren&#39;t even focused on them.

&quot;Good girl,&quot; he says.  Before you know it&#39;s happening, you feel his lips press against your cheek in a soft, gentle kiss.  The corner of his mouth touches the corner of yours and you flinch away.  The man just kissed you!  Your mind is reeling as Mr. Kail&#39;s eyes go back to the pages still in your hand.

&quot;Six obvious typos on page one.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll do better tomorrow morning.&quot;  Ha.  You made fewer mistakes than Becky.  Wait.  Tomorrow?  Oh Hell.  Surely you won&#39;t have to do this for five weeks like Becky.  Right?  If only you could quit this job.  But you can&#39;t...not until you get this stupid chastity belt off and find some regular clothes.

&quot;You&#39;re a lucky girl, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;, most new trainees get 40 or 50 spanks on their first day.  &lt;&lt;print $spank&gt;&gt; should be a piece of cake.&quot;

Your brain takes a moment to digest this.  Spanks?  What is he talking about?  You look up at him questioningly, but his attention is diverted by Becky traipsing into the room with three lunch containers.

&quot;Perfect timing, Becky,&quot; he says.  He puts you on your feet as if you were no more than a rag doll for him to play with.  &quot;Let&#39;s go ahead and get your spankings out of the way girls, that way we can enjoy a nice pleasant lunch together.  What do you say?&quot;  Instinctively you don&#39;t respond.  You don&#39;t think this was an actual question.

&quot;Becky would you be kind enough to show our new trainee the proper receiving posture?&quot;

You watch with horror as Becky pulls her skirt up to her hips.  She leans forward to ensure it will stay, and then puts her elbows down on Mr. Kail&#39;s desk.  Her pale thighs practically glow against her stockings and dark, satin underpants.  There&#39;s a surge of pain in your chastity belt from the sight of this woman&#39;s exposed ass.  At the same time, your heart tries to tear itself from your chest in the fearful knowledge that you&#39;ll be expected to assume the same position.

&quot;&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;, I&#39;m going to let you do the honors,&quot; Mr. Kail said stepping around the desk to watch the proceedings, &quot;She had eight typos, which means eight smacks.  Make them good ones.  Lessons aren&#39;t learned from leniency.&quot;

You can&#39;t believe this.  He expects you to spank this woman eight times for mis-typing a couple of words.  Worse yet, the odds are good that Becky is going to spank you for your mistakes.  If you spank her hard, she&#39;ll probably retaliate, but if you don&#39;t spank her hard enough, Mr. Kail could punish you!  This just isn&#39;t fair!

Hopefully she&#39;ll remember your kindness.  If that horrible brute Mr. Kail was being serious, he was going to have you spanked &lt;&lt;print $spank&gt;&gt; times.  At least it would be Becky doing it.  The thought of Mr. Kail bent over you, gives you the chills.

You&#39;re only halfway through her eight spanks when Mr. Kail sighs behind you.

&quot;Don&#39;t think you&#39;re doing her any favors, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  If you&#39;re ordered to spank another secretary, you need to spank her as if you were a manager.  You&#39;ve just doubled her spanks from eight to sixteen.  Now start over and this time I want to hear her squeal.  Or I&#39;ll double both of your whacks...and I&#39;ll be the one to give them!&quot;

You feel terrible.  You were just trying to be nice and now you have to spank the poor girl twice as much.  You turn back to her and see that she&#39;s looking over her shoulder at you with a mad glare in her eye.  Can&#39;t she see that you were just trying to help?  You spank her again, this time hard.  Her smooth skin vibrates against your palm.  She squeals.  Your panties dampen.  You repeat the process over and over.  By the sixteenth smack, your hand hurts.  You can only imagine how Becky must feel.

Her ass glows as you finish the final spanking.  She stands up, letting her skirt fall back into place.  You see the tears in her eyes, but there is something else there too.  Anger.  You have an uncomfortable suspicion that its not directed at Mr. Kail.  She&#39;s angry at YOU!

&quot;Your turn, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.&quot;  Oh God.  Can this get any worse?

You can sense Becky walking up behind you.  You shut your eyes.  Your jaw clamps shut.  Oh god, why is this happe...

SMACK!

Its worse than you imagine!  Your smooth, sensitive skin seems to amplify the pain.  Becky&#39;s not holding back.  Not even a little bit.  You feel a sense of resentment towards the bitch, despite the fact that you did the same thing to her only a minute before.

The anger that fills his eyes makes you sorry that you spoke.

&quot;You obviously haven&#39;t learned a single thing today, you stupid slut,&quot; the horrible man growls, &quot;I&#39;m trying to teach you how to be a good, obedient little girl and you complain at every turn.  I should take you downstairs and let the whole office spank your insolent little ass!&quot;

&quot;No, Mr. Kail...NO...please...&quot; you cry.  Your legs have given out underneath you.  Through tear filled eyes you peer up at the hulking brute above.  There is no sympathy on his face at all.

&quot;I&#39;m doubling your punishment! &lt;&lt;print $spank&gt;&gt; whacks!  Do you want more?&quot;

&quot;No, Mr. Kail,&quot; you whimper.  From the corner of your eye you see Becky smirk.  The bitch is enjoying your punishment.

Slowly you get back to your feet.  The other two watch you with disdain and disgust.

[[Click here to continue.|lunch]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="95" name="lunch" tags="" position="600,1225">Your ass is on fire.  The good news is, you and Becky are allowed to eat standing up.  The bad news is...everything else about the meal.  Apparently secretaries at M&amp;R aren&#39;t allowed to use silverware.  You really should have READ the contract better.  Eating salad with your fingers is not pleasant.  Unfortunately, that&#39;s not the only impediment.

Mr. Kail ordered you to feed Becky...and for her to feed you.

So here you are, your fingers covered in a gooey Caesar dressing, trying to eat the pinch of lettuce that Becky holds between her fingers, while watching Becky&#39;s lips wrap around your own.  There&#39;s no good way to do it, save putting her fingers in your mouth and letting her drop the food onto your tongue.  She seems to have no reservations about this activity.  Her own mouth eagerly wraps around your salad holding fingers, sucking the dressing off with no hesitation at all.  The slut almost seems to enjoy it.

Slowly you finish the meal.  The salads were miniscule and your stomach gurgles, feeling slighted.  You glare at Mr. Kail.  He pops the last bite of his turkey sandwich into his mouth with a grin.

&quot;Still hungry girls?&quot; he chuckles, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I have dessert for you.&quot;

The sexual tone to his voice frightens the hell out of you.  Then you see the cup of tapioca pudding that came with his lunch and you feel better.  Phew.

He pops open the lid and dips one of his big, beefy fingers into it.  He holds the finger out to Becky.  She doesn&#39;t hesitate.

Her lips wrap around it and she sucks the pudding into her greedy little mouth.  You can&#39;t believe how slutty she is!  You would never...

The same finger is extended toward you, pudding gooped all over it, the finger underneath it glistening with Becky&#39;s saliva.


[[Eat the pudding.|suck][$score_sub += 1]]
[[Turn it down.|no_suck][$score_dom += 1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="96" name="suck" tags="" position="725,1225">Your stomach gurgles.  Once again you&#39;re faced with a choice that doesn&#39;t feel like much of a choice.  If you don&#39;t accept the pudding, this horrible man will punish you again.  Your ass is still scalding from the brutal beating Becky gave you and the thought of another spanking makes you want to weep.  At the same time, eating food from a woman&#39;s finger was one thing...sucking food off a man&#39;s finger was a different story entirely.

Determined not to be punished again, you lean forward and wrap your lips around his finger.  It feels warm and meaty inside your mouth, and you fight back the gag reflex.  You use your lips to scrape the pudding off into you mouth.  The flavor is tapioca, but the way you got it into your mouth makes the texture really unpleasant.

&quot;Well?&quot; Mr. Kail asks, &quot;Do&#39;t I get a thank you?&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Mr. Kail,&quot; you and Becky say in near unison.

&quot;Yeah...thanks for letting us suck your finger you egotistical prick,&quot; you think.  You&#39;ve got to get out of here!

Mr. Kail looks at his watch.

&quot;Looks like our time is up for this morning.  Becky!  Give &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt; a kiss and thank her for feeding you lunch.&quot;

Did he just say...

Suddenly Becky is pressing up against you.  Her lips meet yours and you find yourself locked in a kiss.  You can smell her flowery scent merging with your own.  Her painted lips taste sweet, much as yours must taste.  You feel her tongue flick against your lip, not entering your mouth but exploring just a tiny bit.  Your locked away member spits in pleasure and protest. Then she pulls away, her head down, her face flushed with embarrassment.  You feel an utmost certainty that she thinks you&#39;re really a woman.  The guilty look on her face proves it to you once and for all.  She feels guilty for kissing another girl.

&quot;&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;!  Kiss Becky goodbye and thank her for lunch.&quot;


[[Kiss her soft and sweetly.|kiss_soft][$score_sub += 1]]
[[Kiss her hard and passionately.|kiss_hard][$score_dom += 1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="97" name="no_suck" tags="" position="850,1225">&quot;No thank you,&quot; you say politely.  You cringe as the bad look enters his face again.  &quot;This wasn&#39;t an offer, bitch&quot; he growls, &quot;Eat the pudding, or I&#39;ll smack your ass until it burns hotter than the sun.&quot;

You don&#39;t think that would take long.  Your rear end already feels like its had all the skin peeled off of it.

Without waiting for your consent, Mr. Kail jams the finger towards your mouth.  The gooey stuff gets all over your face, before the finger finds its way between your lips. You think about biting the finger for a minute, but the repurcusions of that act flood through your mind like a nightmare.

You feel the big, beefy digit on your tongue.  What else can you do?  Better to get this over with. You wrap your lips around his finger.  It feels warm and meaty inside your mouth, and you fight back the gag reflex.  You use your lips to scrape the pudding into your mouth.

Mr Kail looks at you and laughs.

&quot;You know what you look like?&quot; he chuckles.  You realize he&#39;s talking about the white cream all over your lips and cheek.  You flush with horror and quickly wipe your face with the back of your hands, much to Mr. Kail&#39;s amusement.  You&#39;ve never felt so degraded in your life.  Each moment in this place seems to get worse and worse.

&quot;Well?&quot; Mr. Kail asks, &quot;Don&#39;t I get a thank you?&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Mr. Kail,&quot; you and Becky say in near unison.

&quot;Yeah...thanks for letting us suck your finger you egotistical prick,&quot; you think.  You&#39;ve got to get out of here!

You lean in toward Becky, feeling her body against yours again.  God!  What you wouldn&#39;t give to be alone with her and have this stupid chastity belt off for ten minutes.  You feel like you&#39;re about to explode from pent up sexual tension.  You gently put your lips against hers, feeling their moist tenderness melt into your own.  Her tongue once again tickles your lip and then surprisingly slips into your mouth.  You can feel her trepidation about kissing a girl even as she explores for a quick second before pulling away again.  Her face burns as bright as your backside feels.  She liked it.  You have a feeling she&#39;s as turned on as you are.

&quot;All right, girls,&quot; he says, walking around to your side of the desk.  He wraps an arm around Becky, pulls her into an embrace and kisses her himself.  He makes your own kiss look tame.  His tongue does Olympic events into her mouth.  One of his hands goes to the back of her neck.  She moans at his touch, even as his other hand drifts downwards toward her backside.  The kiss lasts forever, Becky surrendering to the brute&#39;s every will.  He pulls away, leaving her gasping for breath.

Then he turns toward you.

Oh God.

He pulls you into himself, his massive body dwarfing your own.  His lips meet yours with a harshness and you feel his tongue instantly start intruding inward.  He explores your closed teeth with a passion and you feel his hands begin to explore your body.  The one that clamps onto your neck, squeezes just hard enough to make you open your mouth.  This lets the slimy intruder in and it begins to conquer the dark region with its writhing and wriggling.  His other hand grabs your ass, pressing your body closer and harder against him.  You feel the rigid thing that presses against your belly.  You struggle to get away from this animal, but he holds you tight letting you go only when he finishes his exploration.

You find yourself gasping for breath just as much as Becky, even as your mind tries to come to grips with what just happened.  A man just KISSED you!

&quot;How do you like your new slut?&quot; a voice from the door asks.  All three of you turn to see the woman leaning in the door frame.

You know, without a doubt, that the smirk on Miss Payne&#39;s face is due to your predicament.  She just watched this brute molest your mouth.  She never told him you were a guy.  He thinks you&#39;re just as much of a slut as Becky and this woman never even hinted otherwise.  Your hatred for her swells to epic proportions.

&quot;She&#39;s a hot little thing,&quot; Mr. Kail says, squeezing your ass for emphasis.  You can&#39;t suppress a squeal. &quot;It&#39;s gonna be a lot of fun breaking her in.&quot;

What did he mean by that?

&quot;Well at least you&#39;ve found a way to keep that sassy mouth of hers busy,&quot; Miss Payne laughs.

&quot;Yeah...that&#39;s one way.&quot; he says.  He smacks your aching ass hard enough to cause you to leap forward.  Becky is already heading toward Miss Payne.

&quot;Bye, girls,&quot; Mr. Kail says, his voice full of good cheer, &quot;See you tomorrow.&quot;

He heads back to his desk, as you and Becky follow Miss Payne out of the room and back towards the elevator.

You squeeze her closer to yourself, trying to enjoy every last second of this.  She allows your exploration, tickling your tongue with her own. You can feel her shivering in your arms.  She&#39;s scared, terrified of the taboo of kissing another woman, but at the same time unable to stop herself from enjoying it.

&quot;Looks like I&#39;ve got some horny little sluts on my hands,&quot; Mr. Kail chuckles.  You break the kiss and see that he&#39;s staring at the two of you intently, a hungry look in his eyes.

She is standing perfectly straight with her hands tucked behind her back.  Her chest is puffed out, her perfectly formed breasts straining at the thin fabric of her blouse. Her head is lowered, with her eyes on her feet, the perfect display of feminine submission.  She&#39;s making you look bad and at the same time driving you mad with lust.  You can&#39;t help but stare at her breasts as she breathes slowly in and out...

&quot;&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;!&quot; Miss Payne growls without looking at you, &quot;Stand up straight.  You don&#39;t see Becky slouching do you?&quot;

You glare at Becky.  You might be wrong, but you think you see a slight smirk on her face.  Well if she thinks she&#39;s better than you, you&#39;ll show her.

You copy her posture, standing even straighter and stiffer than the brown-nosing bitch.  You wait expectantly for a compliment from Miss Payne.  It doesn&#39;t come.  This is SO unfair!

With your head hung submissively you have a good view of your heel-clad feet.  God they hurt!  The horrid shoes feel like vices.

They sure do make your legs look sexy though.  What did Miss Payne call them?  Fuck me shoes?

A throb in your chastity belt confirms this.  Why should the idea of wearing &#39;Fuck Me&#39; shoes turn you on?  You&#39;ve got to get out of this crazy place!  You&#39;re wearing shoes that make men want to have sex with you, and what&#39;s worse...they&#39;re locked on your feet!  When they let you out of this ridiculous chastity belt tonight, you&#39;re going to do whatever it takes to get out of here!  Hell you might even change your name.  Today has been the worst, most humiliating day of your life.  With almost no effort these people have dressed you up with an outfit that NO self-respecting woman would EVER wear...much less a MAN!  Only sluts like Becky would enjoy looking like this...being treated like this...

Your legs start to hurt from standing so stiffly.  You shift slightly, trying to take the weight off of your toes.  Your thighs brush together being tickled by the lace of your slinky, &lt;&lt;print $panty_color&gt;&gt; panties.  Your trapped member throbs.  God what you wouldn&#39;t give to be out of this chastity belt!

You shift legs again, feeling the &lt;&lt;print $stockings&gt;&gt; stockings rub together.  Your panties dampen again.  This is unbearable!  Every move you make only makes you more sexually frustrated!

You glance over at Becky to see if she shows any similar signs of frustration.  You realize your mistake at once.  Seeing her beautiful body crammed into the provactive outfit that you share only causes the prisoner between your legs to drool more!  You shift again, unable to help yourself, needing the caress of the lacey underwear against your thighs.

&quot;&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;!  Stop squirming! I&#39;m not going to tell you again!&quot;

You stand up straight again, feeling the garter straps snap tight to your bare skin.  This is SO unfair.  You only shifted from one foot to the other.  You can see that smirk on Becky&#39;s face again out of the corner of your eye. You&#39;re really starting to HATE her!

&quot;Becky wait here.  &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;!  Follow me!&quot;

She storms out of the elevator and you prance after her, walking as fast as you can in the heels.  You have to take almost twice as many steps as her to keep up, your arm swinging out to the side to keep balance. You don&#39;t think you&#39;ll ever get used to the stupid shoes.  How do women stand them?

She heads down the hall towards the break room and a sudden ray of hope fills your heart.  She&#39;s going let you go.  Maybe this was all just a joke.  Maybe she&#39;ll give you your clothes back now.  She&#39;ll take this stupid chastity belt off and...

She stops.  Not in front of the break room door, but in front of the one on the opposite side of the hall.  What...?

&quot;I recommend that you mind your manners and do what you&#39;re told,&quot; she says.  There&#39;s almost a trace of sympathy in her voice.  What is she talking about?  &quot;With any luck, it won&#39;t be that bad.&quot;

You&#39;re still trying to figure out what she&#39;s talking about when she grabs your wrist and drags you into the room.  When you see the man behind the desk, you suddenly remember why you must be here!  Surely this is a mistake...

&quot;Mr. Johnson.  I&#39;m sorry to bother you.&quot; Miss Payne says, &quot;Here&#39;s the intern from this morning.&quot;

Mr. Johnson&#39;s eyes drift up for a second and then do a double take back to you.

&quot;You&#39;re joking!&quot; he stands up and moves toward you.  You are so scared you can barely breathe.  You find yourself standing back in the submissive pose from the elevator, if for no other reason that it lets you keep your head down and not look at the dreadful people talking about you.

&quot;You mean to tell me, that this is that insolent little punk from this morning!?!&quot;

Miss Payne nods, that smirk back on her face.  Mr Johnson circles you, his eyes taking in every inch.  Your legs are trembling so bad, you&#39;re afraid your knees are going to knock together.  You&#39;ve been brought here to be punished.  Oh God!  This man is going to punish you for what you said earlier.

&quot;You&#39;ve done good work, Payne,&quot; he chuckles, &quot;Great work.  She&#39;s a knockout.&quot; You feel him pull the back of your skirt up.  &quot;God.  Look at those legs!&quot;  The cold air on your exposed ass causes you to shiver...at least that&#39;s part of the reason.

&quot;She picked the panties herself,&quot; Miss Payne says chuckling.  Your face burns with embarrassment.  You didn&#39;t pick these horrible clothes!  Well you picked from an assortment of them, but...

&quot;She should be very popular with the clients...&quot; Miss Payne continues.  Her tone is matter-of-fact.  They&#39;re not REALLY going to make you deal with clients dressed like this are they?

&quot;Its amazing.  You wouldn&#39;t even know...&quot; Mr. Johnson laughs.  One of his hands caresses your &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; hair.  You feel like a piece of meat.  A piece of REALLY sexy-looking meat.

&quot;I&#39;ve got another girl alone in the elevator,&quot; Miss Payne says, &quot;Is ten minutes enough time?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;ll do,&quot; the man says with a sigh, &quot;Although I&#39;d love to have her here for a couple of hours.&quot;

Miss Payne laughs. Good God!  A couple of hours?

&quot;Put your bid in now.  We&#39;ve already had two offers on her...including Kail.&quot;

Bids?  Kail?

&quot;Kail?&quot; Mr. Johnson sounds as surprised as you, &quot;But he gets the pick of the litter.&quot; He turns toward you.  &quot;Looks like I lucked out when you walked into my office this morning.  Pretty soon, you&#39;re going to be a pricey little thing.&quot;  You don&#39;t quite understand what they&#39;re talking about.  Bid?  They&#39;re talking as if you&#39;re being sold, but they can&#39;t do that.  Can they?  And what was that about Kail?  Mr. Kail bid on you?  This place is getting crazier by the minute.

&quot;I&#39;ll give you fifteen,&quot; Miss Payne says heading for the door.  She&#39;s leaving!  Leaving you with this brute...for FIFTEEN minutes!  &quot;She could use a little extra discipline.&quot;

Then she&#39;s gone and you&#39;re left standing alone with the hulking Mr. Johnson. Your eyes widen as you see that he&#39;s rolling up his sleeve.  This can&#39;t be happening!

&quot;C&#39;mon girl,&quot; he says, emphasizing the word girl to further degrade you, &quot;Climb up on the desk.  We&#39;ve only got fifteen minutes.&quot;


[[Climb onto the desk.|assume_position][$score_sub += 1]]
[[Refuse!|refuse_position][$score_dom += 1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="102" name="assume_position" tags="" position="225,1350">This is a nightmare!

For a moment you think about making a break for the door.  The heels on your feet cause the thought to disappear.  You&#39;d never make it all the way around the brutish Mr. Johnson, and even if you did...where would you go.  Without a keycard for the elevator you&#39;re trapped on this floor.  You look timidly into the man&#39;s eyes and see that you really have no choice.

As if in a dream you slowly put first one arm onto the table, then the other.  You&#39;re trembling so hard that your teeth chatter.

&quot;All the way up!&quot; the beast barks behind you.  Before you can respond, his hand smacks your ass.  Even through the skirt it stings!  You squeal in surprise and clambor up unto the desk aware as you do so that the spank was but one of many to come.  You close your eyes, hoping beyond hope that is this is all just a bad dream.

Then you feel the heat of his rough hand as it rubs against your stocking-clad leg.  You tremble as it slides upward, caressing bare skin, raising your skirt up.  His fingers trail up the underside of your chastity belt and then all the way to the small of your back, dragging the hem of your skirt up with it!    The cold air causes your exposed backside to break out in gooseflesh.  You feel his thumbs hook into the waist of your panties.  You  whimper as they are slowly slid off, pooling on your bent knees.   You begin to tremble, unable to help yourself...and that&#39;s when you see the free-standing mirror facing the desk.  For a minute, you think there&#39;s another girl in here with you and then you see the twin of the man behind you and realize the truth.  There&#39;s only one beautiful &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; haired girl, kneeling half naked on a desk.  YOU!

You gaze into her frightened eyes as you feel warm fingers slide up your bare thighs.

&quot;I really would have no clue, you know?&quot; he says.  His fingers pinch the tender meat between your legs and you squeal. The girl in the mirror bites her pouty, &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; bottom lip, trying to be brave.  You know she&#39;s faking!

&quot;Hell,&quot; he mumbles, his hand lightly tracing from where your dick should be all the way around to the bottom of your asscrack, &quot;You&#39;re prettier than most of the REAL girls we get here.&quot; 

You whimper again.  That can&#39;t be true!  You&#39;re a guy!  That CAN&#39;T be you in the mirror!  

The first smack stops your blood cold.

&quot;Count off!&quot; he growls.

The girl in the mirror counts...each and every blow.  Apparantly, she is braver than she thought.

Seventeen minutes later, Miss Payne finally comes to retrieve you.  Tears run down your face at the sight of her.  Despite the fact that this horrible woman caused you to be in this position, you&#39;re so grateful that she&#39;s come to save you that relief fills ever inch of your body.

&quot;Looks like you two are having fun,&quot; she chuckles, &quot;Should I leave you alone for a bit more?&quot; You shake your head as violently as you can.  She wouldn&#39;t!  She couldn&#39;t!  Fresh tears drip down your face.  Mr Johnson just laughs from behind you.

&quot;Not at the rates you&#39;re going to charge me,&quot; he says.  You stagger slightly trying to regain your balance on the heels and letting circulation flow back to your appendages.  You shudder involuntarily.  You feel dirty from his lingering touch.  You quickly scamper behind Miss Payne, eager to put some distance between yourself and the man who just abused you.

&quot;&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;, here, is going to be pricey, that&#39;s for sure&quot; she laughs grapping your wrist and dragging you for the door, &quot;Get your bid in now!&quot;

She leads you out the door and you can&#39;t help but look back at the horrible man behind the desk.  He&#39;s smirking at you, his eyes deep with lust.  Oh God!  Did that REALLY just happen?

Miss Payne half escorts/half drags you back to the elevator and tosses you inside.  You think for a second that you see Becky smirking at you, but then her face turns back into that blank, submissive look.  You quickly adopt the same posture and expression, wondering as you do so, how things could possibly get any worse.


[[Click here to continue.|goodbye_becky]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="103" name="refuse_position" tags="" position="350,1350">&quot;Fuck you,&quot; the words spit out of your mouth at the hulking brute in front of you.  His eyes widen in anger and you make your first of many attempts to get away.

Seventeen minutes later, Miss Payne finally comes to retrieve you.  Tears run down your face at the sight of her.  Despite the fact that this horrible woman caused you to be in this position, you&#39;re so grateful that she&#39;s come to save you that relief fills every inch of your body.  Your blurry eyes focus, not for the first time, on the free-standing mirror, facing the desk.

Your twin gazes back at you, her eyes equally teary and yet still perfectly beautiful.  The makeup on her face isn&#39;t even smudged, despite the huge streams that drain from her eyes.  Her face is pressed hard against the desk, her long &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; hair wrapped under your head like a tiny pillow.  Her arms are tied tightly to her ankles keeping your ass stuck permanantly up in the air.  Her skirt is pulled up onto her back and her slutty &lt;&lt;print $panty_color&gt;&gt; panties are pulled down.  You know that she aches from the beating she just received, but you also know she&#39;s more concerned with the hard object being pressed against her.  Mr. Johnson stands behind her, hands on her hips, grinding his crotch against the girl&#39;s exposed behind.  Only the thin fabric of his trousers keep him from raping the poor girl.

You glance away from her...from you...back to Miss Payne...back to your rescuer.  For a minute, you think she&#39;s going to leave you here.  Tied up on this madman&#39;s desk, subject to his every whim.  Then she chuckles and clears her throat.

Your tormentor stops grinding against you, which only emphasizes the slimy wetness that has crept through his pants. You feel him pull away.  He&#39;s reluctant.  You can tell by the look of his eyes in the mirror.  He unties you and helps you off the table, taking extra care to rub the beast tenting out his pants against you, one last time.

&quot;Looks like you two are having fun,&quot; she chuckles, &quot;Should I leave you alone for a bit more?&quot; You shake your head as violently as you can.  She wouldn&#39;t!  She couldn&#39;t!  Fresh tears drip down your face.  Mr Johnson just laughs from behind you.

[[Click here to continue.|goodbye_becky]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="104" name="goodbye_becky" tags="" position="475,1350">The elevator stops on floor number seven and Miss Payne grabs Becky&#39;s wrist.

&quot;&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;!  Wait here and DO NOT MOVE!&quot; she growls as she hauls Becky down the hallway.  You continue to hold your submissive pose until she&#39;s out of sight, then cautiously you let your breath out and raise your head.  Your whole body aches.  Your ass feels raw from the horrible spankings, your feet throb from the atrocious shoes and your ribs feel like they&#39;re about to crack from the constricting clothes.  You&#39;ve got to get out of this madhouse somehow.

More time passes and you dance back and forth, trying to let each foot rest a little.  The movement causes the ruffled panties to tickle your thighs again and you grimace as another pleasureless spurt trickles down your leg.  This is unbearable!

You peer down the hallway and still see no sign of Miss Payne.  Maybe now is your chance!


[[She could be back any minute! Better where you are!|be_good][$score_sub += 1]]
[[Now&#39;s your chance! Make a break for it!|be_bad][$score_dom += 1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="105" name="be_good" tags="" position="600,1350">The throbbing of your backside makes your decision for you.  Maybe a better opportunity for escape will come later.  For now, its best to do what you&#39;re told and try not to do anything else wrong.

Two more minutes pass and you feel like your feet are about to fall off.  How do women wear these stupid shoes all the time?  You look down as you continue to dance back and forth from one leg to another.  The tiny gold padlocks on the shoes don&#39;t look that tough.  Maybe if you had a hammer you could break them.  Or a paperclip.  Or something...

A noise causes you to look up.  Standing in the hallway is a tall, dark haired man holding a manilla envelope.  He&#39;s halfway out of a door, as if he stopped only when he noticed you.  His eyes take in every inch of you and the grin on his face would look perfectly normal on the Big, Bad Wolf.

Your face turns bright red as you quickly resume the submissive posture: back arched, head down.  Looking up with only your eyes, you can see him still staring at you.  You feel horribly exposed standing here being stared at.  Does he know you&#39;re really a man?  Or worse, does he NOT know?  You&#39;re trembling a little and you think you can actually HEAR your knees knocking together.

Seeing Miss Payne at the end of the hallway causes a wave of relief to run through you.  At least until the man stops her and whispers in her ear.  The look on her face causes your blood to run cold.

&quot;Mr. Richards says you were fidgeting while I was gone,&quot; she says as she approaches you, &quot;Is that true?&quot;

You look up at him in dismay.  The bastard blows you a kiss before disappearing into his door.  Feeling no more mature than a five year old, you nod your head ashamed.

She growls for a second...actually growls, low, deep and menacing.  Then in a flash she whips a tiny pair of scissors out of her back pocket.  Before you know what she is doing, she has removed the top button of your blouse.  You stare at her in horror.

&quot;Watch your step slut,&quot; she laughs, &quot;You only have three buttons left.&quot;

You stare down at your shirt unable to stop yourself from pouting.  Thankfully nothing is showing yet, but you can&#39;t help but notice that the next button is right at bra level.  If they cut that one off...

&quot;Lesson learned?&quot; she asks you.  You nod your head, blinking back tears of frustration.  This is SO unfair.  You wouldn&#39;t have fidgeted if they hadn&#39;t made you wear these stupid shoes.

&quot;Show me!&quot; Miss Payne growls.  For a minute you don&#39;t know what she wants you to show her.  Then it clicks.  You assume the submissive posture, arching your back as much as you can and lowering your head to stare at your feet.  You can&#39;t remember being more uncomfortable, but what little modesty you have left is at stake.  You&#39;ll be damned if you let her take ANOTHER button.


[[Click here to continue.|training_3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="106" name="be_bad" tags="" position="725,1350">There are a dozen doors before the hallway turns a corner and they all look identical.  You cross your fingers and take a deep breath, wincing as you notice your breasts raising up off your chest. You&#39;ve GOT to get out of this outfit.

You slip inside the door, shutting it behind you grateful to have seen no sign of the horrible Miss Payne.  Your relief doesn&#39;t last.

&quot;Excellent timing!&quot; says the woman behind the desk.  You glance around confused.  The woman is giving some sort of presentation to two men sitting on the couch opposite her.  They all glance at you expectantly.  You wince and try to find the doorknob behind your back.

&quot;Girl!&quot; the woman says.  Oh God!  She means you!  &quot;Please come display the secretary work outfit for these nice gentlemen.&quot;


[[Run away!|run_away_3][$score_dom += 1]]
[[Show off your outfit!|show_off_outfit][$score_sub += 1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="107" name="run_away_3" tags="" position="850,1350">This has gone far enough.  You try to think of the right words that could extradite you from this situation.  Nothing comes to mind. Unable to think of anything better, you mumble, &quot;sorry&quot; and make a break for the door.  The hallway is still empty as you shut the door behind you.  You turn around to try and figure out where to go next when the door you just came out of slams open.  The woman storms out, shutting the door behind her and then roughly grabs your wrist.

&quot;You must be new,&quot; she growls, &quot;But so help me God, if you lose this account for me I&#39;ll have your tits in a vice.&quot; She leans in close to your face, squeezing the bones in your wrist until they ache.  &quot;Now you are going to get BACK in that room and do EVERYTHING I tell you to do.  Do you understand me, bitch?&quot;  You nod your head, if only to get her to release her death grip on your arm.  &quot;Now I&#39;m going to let you go, but I want you to go back in that room and show those nice men the cute little outfit you have on.  Understand?&quot;  You nod again.  You&#39;re afraid that if you open your mouth to speak, a scream of pain will come out instead.  

Finally, she lets go, but her hand on your back pushes you firmly toward the door.  You have to scramble to get it open before she shoves you through it.

You timidly step into the center of the room, uncomfortably aware of every eye on you.  When you get to the center, you let your eyes drift to the men on the couch.  They&#39;re both staring intently at you, eyes wide and mouths slightly ajar.  You wonder if they can tell you&#39;re really a man?  Dear God, this is humiliating!

&quot;What&#39;s your name, girl?&quot; the man on the left asks.  For a minute your mind goes blank.  Instinctively you start to say your real name and then bite the words off before they leave your lips.

&quot;Well?&quot; the woman behind the desk barks, &quot;Tell them your name, girl!&quot;

&quot;...&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;...&quot; you mumble, your cheeks on fire.  The men chuckle.  They know.  They just have to know you&#39;re not really a girl.

&quot;This is the outfit the girls are required to wear while assisting at the office.&quot; the woman says.  It sounds like she&#39;s given this speech before. &quot;Give them a twirl, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.&quot;  You slowly spin around, mortified that your skirt flares up to show the tops of your stockings.

&quot;Now all of our girls are allowed to pick their own delicates, but each one of them is equipped with a chastity belt to protect them for their eventual Employer.&quot;

The man on the right looks at you, confused.  &quot;Chastity Belt?&quot;

&quot;&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;, please pull down your panties and raise your skirt for these gentlemen.  It will be easier for them to see for themselves.&quot;

You turn to stare at her in horror.  She can&#39;t be serious!

As if your watching someone else, you see your hands with the long, &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; nails, slip underneath your skirt.  The &lt;&lt;print $panty_color&gt;&gt; panties drop to the ground and pool around the uncomfortable heels.  You realize you&#39;re holding your breath and that you&#39;re about to bite through your lower lip.  You can&#39;t believe you&#39;re about to...

With trembling hands you raise your skirt up and display your locked away crotch to the room.  The guys burst out laughing and your cheeks turn even brighter red.

&quot;Shoot darlin&#39;,&quot; the man on the right says, &quot;Isn&#39;t that uncomfortable?&quot;

The woman behind the desk just laughs.

&quot;I assure you, they are not painful,&quot; she says going back to her pre-written speech, &quot;Although they do manage to keep the girls in a perpetual sexually-anxious state. &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;, please walk over there and show these gentlemen what I mean.&quot;

Oh god.  This just keeps getting worse.  You start to move toward the couch, and realize that your panties are still around your ankles.  Carefully you step out of them and take a few steps closer to the couch, still holding up your skirt.  How could this get any worse!?!

&quot;Go on,&quot; the woman behind the desk says, &quot;feel between her legs.&quot;  

What!?!

The man on the left, grabs your wrist and pulls you over to right in front of him.  Before you can regain your balance, you feel his hand snake up between your thighs.  You cry out in surprise and horror.  Now he&#39;ll know.  Now he&#39;ll know for sure that you&#39;re a guy!

&quot;She&#39;s soaking wet, Jack,&quot; the man says, &quot;Check it out.&quot;

You&#39;re pulled over to the other man who pushes his own hand between your legs.

&quot;Damn!&quot; he says, his fingers continuing to rub your belt and thighs, &quot;Its like she&#39;s in HEAT!&quot;  They all laugh as the man continues to explore your crotch with his fingers.  Despite your terror, your body betrays you and spurts a fresh drip of juice into the belt.  It oozes out onto the man&#39;s fingers and it suddenly dawns on you.  None of them know you&#39;re a guy!  With this belt on, no one knows that you&#39;re male.  They even think the juice between your legs is a woman&#39;s.  You&#39;re so taken aback by this that you barely notice as your member shoots another squirt of juice onto the man&#39;s finger.

Your thoughts turn back to his hand as it moves further back his middle finger sliding between the cheeks of your behind.  You try to jerk away from him, but between the hand on your wrist and the hand between your legs it&#39;s difficult to get away without making a scene.

&quot;What about her backside?&quot; your molester asks a finger tracing the small back strap of your belt. &quot;Is that protected too?&quot;

&quot;That orfice is left open for elimination and training purposes,&quot; the woman says, &quot;But it is strictly forbidden for any of our clients to take advantage of this.&quot; You breath a sigh of relief. 

&quot;At least until after the auction.&quot;

What?!? She can&#39;t be...

&quot;Use of her mouth is complimentary to any prospective client, of course.&quot; Your eyes widen in horror as the words filter through your brain.  This place is insane!  They can&#39;t expect you to honestly...

The sound of a zipper pounds into your ears and your head whips around to see the man on the left reaching into his pants.  Dear God...

&quot;Sign me up!&quot; the man says.  His hand wrestles with a bulge that seems too large to get out of the denim confines.

&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; the woman says calmly, &quot;Let&#39;s finish our tour of the facilities first and then I promise you...You will be fully...Satisfied.&quot; 

You feel like you&#39;re about to faint from terror even as the man begins to zip his pants back up.  You still can&#39;t believe it.  He expected you to...

&quot;Thank you for the demonstration, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  You may go!&quot; the woman behind the desk says.  You practically run for the door.  You&#39;re almost in the hall before you hear one of the men laugh behind you.

&quot;&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;!&quot; he yells, &quot;You forgot your panties!&quot;

Blushing furiously you scamper back into the room.  You step into the slinky, &lt;&lt;print $panty_color&gt;&gt; things and slither them up your legs.  You know that they&#39;re still watching your every movement and you can&#39;t get out of there fast enough.  

You shut the door as quickly and quietly as you can and turn around to figure out where to go next.

Only to crash into Miss Payne.

&quot;I give you a simple instruction,&quot; she growls slapping your face so hard that you hear bells, &quot;And you can&#39;t even do THAT right!&quot;  She grabs your arm and drags you almost faster than you can run.

Back in the elevator, she releases your arm and begins to rifle through her satchel.

&quot;Turn around,&quot; she barks, but not before you see what she pulls out of her bag.  It&#39;s a tiny posterboard sign with words written on it in big, red, letters.  It reads:

     I&#39;ve been a bad girl.  If you have time, please spank me!  

She fastens it to the small of your back, so that you can feel the bottom of the sign on the top of your ass everytime you move.  You close your eyes in resignation.  Dressed as you are, any guy you meet would gladly drop what they were doing to get a chance at smacking your behind.  Why did you leave the elevator?

You open your eyes when you feel the tug on your shirt.  Miss Payne is standing in front of you with a pair of scissors and worse...she&#39;s just cut off the top button of your blouse.  You stare at her in horror.

&quot;Watch your step slut,&quot; she laughs, &quot;You only have three buttons left.&quot;

&quot;I give you a simple instruction,&quot; she growls slapping your face so hard that you hear bells, &quot;And you can&#39;t even do THAT right!&quot;  She grabs your arm and drags you almost faster than you can run.

Back in the elevator, she releases your arm and begins to rifle through her satchel.

&quot;Turn around,&quot; she barks, but not before you see what she pulls out of her bag.  It&#39;s a tiny posterboard sign with words written on it in big, red, letters.  It reads:

     I&#39;ve been a bad girl.  If you have time, please spank me!  

She fastens it to the small of your back, so that you can feel the bottom of the sign on the top of your ass everytime you move.  You close your eyes in resignation.  Dressed as you are, any guy you meet would gladly drop what they were doing to get a chance at smacking your behind.  Why did you leave the elevator?

You open your eyes when you feel the tug on your shirt.  Miss Payne is standing in front of you with a pair of scissors and worse...she&#39;s just cut off the top button of your blouse.  You stare at her in horror.

&quot;Watch your step slut,&quot; she laughs, &quot;You only have three buttons left.&quot;

You stare down at your shirt unable to stop yourself from pouting.  Thankfully nothing is showing yet, but you can&#39;t help but notice that the next button is right at bra level.  If they cut that one off...

&quot;Lessons learned?&quot; she asks you.  You nod your head, blinking back tears of frustration.  This is SO unfair.

&quot;Show me!&quot; Miss Payne growls.  For a minute you don&#39;t know what she wants you to show her.  Then it clicks.  You assume the submissive posture, arching your back as much as you can and lowering your head to stare at your feet.  You can&#39;t remember being more uncomfortable, but what little modesty you have left is at stake.  You&#39;ll be damned if you let her take ANOTHER button.


[[Click here to continue.|training_3][$spanksign = true]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="109" name="training_3" tags="" position="1100,1350">The elevator opens and Miss Payne wastes no time dragging you down the hall.  You&#39;re so concerned about staying on your feet in the horrible heels that you quickly lose track of all the twists and turns through the corridors.  When she finally does come to a stop outside of an ominous-looking closed door, you realize you have absolutely no idea of the way back to the elevator.  Not that you could use it without an access card anyway.

She drags you roughly into a small waiting area that has a couch, a chair and a small office desk in the corner.

&quot;Have a seat.&quot; Miss Payne says, &quot;Your supervisor will be out to meet you in a second.  I&#39;ll be back to get you at five-thirty.&quot; 

Your eyes flick to the inner door of the waiting area.  Your supervisor. Butterflies fill your stomach and for a minute you think you&#39;re going to be sick.  You&#39;re expected to be a full-fledged secretary for someone...dressed like THIS.  Your eyes go wide as Miss Payne disappears, shutting the door behind her.  Your first instinct is to run. To your horror, the door back to the hallway has no handle on it.  There&#39;s a small black panel where the door knob should be that must be laser activated.  You&#39;re trapped in here at the mercy of whoever is behind the other door.  You stand there, shifting back and forth from one uncomfortably heeled foot to the other, not sure what to do.  Sitting down seems like a winning plan though, if only to get off these stilts they have you walking around in.

You spin around and see the woman from the elevator earlier.  Miss Worthington.  The one that had appraised you like a piece of meat. You shrink away as she draws close.

&quot;Apparantly, I&#39;m lucky to get you,&quot; she says, her hand stroking your cheek, &quot;Miss Payne said that you have several bids on you already.  Do you know how rare that is?&quot;  You stare at her unable to comprehend what she&#39;s saying.  Bids?  They&#39;ve already started auctioning you off!?!

Her hand stops stroking your cheek and grabs your face, puckering up your lips.

&quot;You&#39;re going to fetch a pretty penny, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; she says, &quot;I&#39;m just lucky I saw you first.&quot;

She leans in close to you, her hand still forcing your face into a puckered position.

&quot;If Miss Payne hadn&#39;t told me, I never would have known,&quot; she whispers into your ear, &quot;You&#39;re very convincing...&quot;

Your eyes spring wide open.  She knows!  She knows you&#39;re a guy!

&quot;And I thought you were just an innocent, wide-eyed girl when I first saw you.  No wonder you were so skittish!  Although with how well you pass for a girl I find it hard to believe you haven&#39;t tried it before!

&quot;But you&#39;ve never been TREATED like the slut you are until today, right?&quot; she asks, pulling you toward her.  Her face is only inches away from yours, her body pressed up against you. &quot;You may have slutty eyes, but they&#39;re an innocent slut&#39;s eyes.&quot;

You turn to look at her, not liking the grin spread out across her face.

&quot;Oh, this is excellent!  Come here!&quot; She sits down on the love seat opposite the desk and waits for you to totter over to her.  Your feet scream in agony at each step. The second you&#39;re within arm range of her, her hand grabs your arm and spins you around.  It takes every ounce of concentration just to keep on your feet.  Then you remember what she must be looking at...

&quot;Aren&#39;t you just the little slut,&quot; she says, fingering the &#39;Please Spank Me&#39; sign pinned to your back, &quot;Your first day and already begging to be bent over.  The clients are going to love you...&quot;  Your eyes widen.  Surely she can&#39;t mean that her clients would actually...

&quot;Well come on, let&#39;s get my five out of the way...&quot; she pats her lap.

This just keeps getting worse.  Your ass is still on fire from the earlier beatings and now she expects you to crawl across her lap for ANOTHER ONE?


[[Crawl across her lap.|female_spank_easy][$score_sub += 1]]

She shifts you around as if you were a rag doll and you find your face pushed hard into the couch, your legs dangling up in the air.

&quot;That was very well done, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;, but you neglected to pull your skirt up.  I will only add an additional five since it is your first day...but be sure to remember that when the clients arrive later.&quot;

You&#39;re still trying to comprehend what she said, when her hand whips down onto your exposed cheek.  You yelp in pain, every ounce of your attention on your abused backside.  You brace yourself for the next one.  It doesn&#39;t come.

&quot;&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;, Mr. Kail should have taught you better than that...remember to count off.  Now I&#39;m going to start over.  Let&#39;s hear those numbers in that pretty little voice of yours, all right?&quot; 

Her hand smacks down on your backside again.  Why, oh why, didn&#39;t you count out that first one.  How will you ever get through ten of these.  Tears fill your eyes, and you clench your fists, willing the words to come out.

&quot;One...&quot;  Smack. &quot;T...two.&quot; Smack. &quot;Threeee.&quot;

The tenth one feels as if her hand is made of barbed-wire.  Tears flow freely from your eyes now, and your breath hitches in great big, pitiful sounding sobs.

&quot;All over,&quot; Miss Worthington says, her voice gentle despite the ferocious beating she just gave you, &quot;We&#39;ll get that naughtiness beaten out of you yet.&quot;

One of her hands softly rests on your flaming behind and you wince as if she spanked you again.

&quot;It really is quite remarkable how nicely you have turned out,&quot; she says.  Her hand begins to slowly rub your left ass cheek, making it feel surprisingly better.  &quot;Even from this angle, I wouldn&#39;t be able to guess...&quot;

Even as tears continue to drain out of your eyes, your body responds to the gentle caress of her hand.  Your trapped equipment spurts, continuing to keep your panties wet and sticky.

&quot;I asked for you, because I thought you&#39;d be good advertising for my clients...but that was before I knew of your...special circumstances...&quot;  Her middle finger slides down between your legs, rubbing the sensitive spot right below where the chastity belt ends.  You shudder from the sensation, spurting again. 

&quot;I&#39;m thinking about putting a bid on you, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  I&#39;ve never bid on a secretary before...I&#39;ve just never been real interested in the girls.  But then again...you&#39;re not a girl are you?&quot;  Her finger continues to make small circles, each one getting slightly larger.  You bite back a moan, which still manages to escape your lips as a whimper.

&quot;But I guess, we&#39;ll see how you do today,&quot; she says and without warning dumps you on the ground.  You totter to your feet, just in time to catch the box of tissues she throws at you.  &quot;Dry your eyes and get to work,&quot; she barks.  You blot at your eyes even as you feel her pulling the spank-me sign off your back.

&quot;If anyone around here is going to spank you, it&#39;s going to be me,&quot; she growls throwing the sign in the garbage.  She slams the door to her office and you wipe your bleary eyes again, furious over how they&#39;re treating you here.  Your poor brain can&#39;t figure out which to be more upset about:  Your abused behind, or your imprisoned front.  In either case, BOTH are throbbing.


[[Click here to continue.|sit_at_desk]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="115" name="female_spank_hard" tags="" position="600,1475">&quot;NO!&quot; the word bursts out of your mouth before you have a chance to rethink it.  Her eyes gleam with an evil spark. 

&quot;Whoa-ho, I see there IS a little spark of testosterone left in you after all.  Excellent!&quot;

She gets up and without a word goes into her office.  You can&#39;t even begin to hide the pride you feel in standing up to her.  In fact, while you&#39;re at it, why not go in after her and demand that she open the door and escort you out of this infernal building.  This has gone on MORE than long enough.

Before you can commit to going into her office after her, she reappears in the doorway.  Your eyes drift down to what she&#39;s holding in her hand and your heart tries to burst out of your chest.

&quot;Try to run,&quot; she tells you, brandishing the long, wooden paddle with the holes drilled in it, &quot;I&#39;m in better shoes than you.&quot;

You make a break for the main door, forgetting that it has no door handle.  Then your ass erupts into flames as she closes the distance between you and connects the wooden paddle to your backside.  You squeal in horror and try to run for her office.  Maybe you can shut the door and lock it...

She follows you inside easily.  The horrible shoes on your feet let her easily outrace you.  The second blow is worse! By the third one you are on your knees, begging her not to hit you again.

&quot;Will you be a good girl and do what you&#39;re told?&quot; she asks you in a condescending, motherly tone.  You nod your head quickly.  Dear Lord, that hurt! 

&quot;Now I still owe you a proper spanking...&quot; she says, &quot;We can do it two ways.  I can use my hand, or I can use the paddle.  I think you&#39;d prefer my hand, but if that&#39;s true you need to PROVE it to me.&quot; She holds her hand out in front of your face as if allowing you to kiss it.  One glance at the paddle is all it takes.

You gently press your lips against the back of her hand, looking up at her with your eyes to judge her reaction.  Her lip curls up in a smile, but it is NOT a pleasant one.

&quot;That&#39;s it?&quot; she asks, &quot;Maybe you prefer the paddle after all.&quot;

&quot;No...please...&quot; you whimper.  She extends one of her fingers, pointing directly at your lips.

&quot;Prove it,&quot; she growls.

&quot;Continue,&quot; she says, extending the rest of the fingers of her hand.  Without hesitation you lightly kiss each one and then the center of her palm.  Your eyes drift upward again, looking at her face, pleading!

&quot;Well aren&#39;t you just the cutest thing, with those big puppy dog eyes,&quot; she says running her worshipped hand through your hair.  &quot;Very well, I shall use my hand, assuming...&quot; she sits back down on the couch, &quot;...assuming you can follow directions.&quot;  She pats her thighs again as you scramble to your feet.

You watch cross-eyed as a tiny line of liquid trails between her finger and your lips before stretching so thin that it snaps.

You spin around and come face to face with the man who felt you up in the elevator.

&quot;I had to pull a lot of strings to get you into my office,&quot; Mr. Elliot says.  He keeps standing a little too close to you and everytime you shrink back he steps in close again.  When you feel the wall against your back, your heart begins to beat triple time, even as he steps in close again.

&quot;And then after I go to ALL THAT trouble, Miss Payne informs me of your...extra features...&quot;

Your eyes open wide in horror.  He knows! He KNOWS you&#39;re a guy!  He&#39;s going to kill you...

&quot;Is it true!?!&quot; he asks, &quot;Cause I still don&#39;t believe it!&quot;  You don&#39;t know what to say and before you can think of anything, his hand goes to your throat.  Oh Lord, he&#39;s going to choke you to death...

&quot;Well the obvious way to check is locked up like all the other girls, but let&#39;s see what you have under this collar...&quot; he growls as his fingers probe your neck.  You suddenly understand what he&#39;s looking for.  Your Adam&#39;s apple.  He still doesn&#39;t believe that you&#39;re a guy, even after Miss Payne TOLD him!

&quot;Well, I&#39;ll be damned...&quot; he says, his fingers going from your neck to your cheek.  He caresses it as if you were a fine piece of china. &quot;You&#39;re a guy! I see it and I STILL don&#39;t believe it!&quot;

His hand moves up and runs through your hair, settling down to the back of your neck.  He&#39;s standing so close, hulking over you, that you can smell his cologne, mingling with the flowery smell emanating off of you.

&quot;Scratch that,&quot; he says, his fingers clamping down on the back your neck, &quot;You&#39;re not a guy.  No self-respecting guy would let this be done to them!  So you must enjoy looking like this...being treated like this, right?  I mean you even act and sound like a girl.  This can&#39;t be the first time you&#39;ve done this?

The smile on his face tells you that this is exactly what he believes.  

&quot;All right, fine...You&#39;ve never dressed up like this before...&quot; he says, his voice rich with condescension, &quot;But you&#39;re here now...you&#39;ve signed a contract...and for the next four and a half hours...&quot; his lips go right next to your ear, &quot;...you belong to me...&quot;.

You can&#39;t stop trembling.  He&#39;s right.  The exit doesn&#39;t even have a door knob.  You can&#39;t get out of here and you&#39;re stuck, looking like a porn star, with your every move dictated by this horrible man pressing against you.  You feel his lips against your ear and you shiver.  Then he&#39;s stepping away, heading back toward his office.

&quot;Follow the instructions of the computer.  Mr. Penler will be in later and I want you in there so I can show you off.  Understand?&quot; You nod your head, not that any part of his speech was a question.  You hurry to your desk, eager to get off of the uncomfortable stilts.

&quot;Nope...You&#39;re not a guy...You&#39;re not a MAN!&quot; You feel him raise your skirt up onto your back, exposing your backside to him.  The cool air of the room brushes across your bare thighs which only increases your trembling.

&quot;God!  Look at that ass!&quot; Mr Elliot says, his hand resting on your right cheek. &quot;No wonder you want guys spanking you!&quot; The hand on your ass squeezes and you yelp.  He only laughs again.

Then without warning, his hand smacks your backside so hard that tears well up in your eyes.  You jerk upright, unable to help yourself, but his hand catches your neck when you&#39;re only halfway up.

&quot;Nonononono...&quot; he says, pushing your neck back down until your face is almost touching your shins, &quot;You stay down there until I&#39;m done, or I&#39;m going to have to take off my belt...&quot;

&quot;Now I&#39;m going to start over and this time I want you to stay standing just like that and count off, got it?&quot;

Without waiting for an answer, he smacks you again.  Tears begin to flow and through clenched teeth you hear yourself say, &quot;One.&quot;

Nine more follow.  By the end, you&#39;re crying like a baby, breath hitching in great big sobs.

Time seems to stand still and despite the numerous spankings you received today, the only thing you can suddenly feel, is the hard cylinder pressing against your backside.  You whimper in fear, as he grinds against you. 

&quot;God, you&#39;re hot...&quot; he mumbles, his hands grabbing your hips and pulling you against him. In this slow-motion horror movie you&#39;ve found yourself in, you stare at his legs behind the ones clad in the sexy, &lt;&lt;print $stockings&gt;&gt; stockings.  Your long, &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; hair pools down around your feet.  Your pushed up &#39;breasts&#39; press against your legs.  You seem to notice every feeling, every molecule of your body.  The way the garter straps are stretched tight against your thighs.  The way your skirt is pooled up on your back.  Even the way you can see down into your cleavage because of that missing button.  But most of all, you feel the rock-hard cylinder behind you, nestled in the crack of your ass. You&#39;re uncomfortably aware that only the thin material of his pants and the thinner material of your panties keeps his monster from entering you.

&quot;God, I wish we were allowed to...&quot; he stammers and then without warning you find yourself being pushed forward.  You collapse in a heap on the ground and watch in relief as Mr. Elliot heads toward his office.

&quot;Clean yourself up and get to work, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.&quot; he says.  Without warning, he yanks the spank-me sign from your back.

&quot;Don&#39;t think this lets you off the hook, bitch,&quot; he growls, &quot;I just don&#39;t want anyone else groping that ass of yours.  From now on, it belongs to me!&quot;

Then he&#39;s gone. 

Sniffling, you scramble to your feet.  There&#39;s a box of tissues on the end table next to the couch and you use one to blot the tears off your face.  You&#39;re about to head to your new desk when you notice again how wet and sticky you are between your legs.  Only as you&#39;re wiping out your soaking panties with a tissue do you realize that your member is continuing to throb in its locked confinement.


[[Click here to continue.|sit_at_desk]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="123" name="male_spank_hard" tags="" position="350,1600">&quot;NO!&quot; the word bursts out of your mouth before you can even consider the ramifications.  You see the gleam in his eye and suddenly you  think you might have just made another huge mistake.

Calmly...too calmly...he unfastens his belt.  By the time your brain figures out what he intends to do with it, he&#39;s already slid it mostly out of the loops.  You make a mad dash for the door, forgetting that there is no handle to open it.  You scream as something bites your leg and when you turn around your heart stops beating for a second.

&quot;Bend over&quot; he says tapping the belt in his hands.  Apparently you don&#39;t do it quick enough, because the belt &#39;bites you again&#39;.  Your conscious mind switches off and the next thing you know, you&#39;re bent over at the waist, with your hands grabbing your ankles.  You whimper as Mr. Elliot runs the belt in figure eights around your arms and legs and then fastens it, pulling it so tight that you almost fall over.  Tears leak out of your eyes as you try to pull free, but you can&#39;t.  The beast has tied you up, leaving your ass vulnerable to anything he wants to do to it.

You feel him raise your skirt up onto your back, exposing your backside to him.  The cool air of the room brushes across your bare thighs which only increases your trembling.

&quot;God!  Look at that ass! If you weren&#39;t a guy, I&#39;d...&quot; Mr Elliot mutters, his hand resting on your right cheek. &quot;Heh.  No wonder you want guys spanking you!&quot; The hand on your ass squeezes and you yelp.  He only laughs again.

Then without warning, his hand smacks your backside so hard that tears well up in your eyes.

&quot;Count off,&quot; he growls behind you.  Without waiting for an answer, he smacks you again.  Tears begin to flow and through clenched teeth you hear yourself say, &quot;One.&quot;

Nine more follow.  By the end, you&#39;re crying like a baby, breath hitching in great big sobs.  Behind you, you hear your tormentor chuckling. &quot;Now that wasn&#39;t so bad, was it?&quot; he says, his hand softly patting your enflamed backside.  You wish more than anything that you could stand up straight.  You&#39;ve never felt more vulnerable, humiliated and abused all at the same time.  Your backside is raw from all the abuse...you can&#39;t take anything else.  

&quot;God, you&#39;ve got a great ass,&quot; he says again, this time pressing up against you.  Time seems to stand still and despite the numerous spankings you received today, the only thing you can suddenly feel, is the hard cylinder pressing agaisnt your backside.  You whimper in fear, as he grinds against you. 

&quot;God, you&#39;re hot...how can you be a guy?&quot; he mumbles, his hands grabbing your hips and pulling you against him. In this slow-motion horror movie you&#39;ve found yourself in, you stare at his legs behind your own.  Behind your own, amazingly sexy, stocking covered legs.  Your long, &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; hair pools down around your feet.  Your pushed up &#39;breasts&#39; press against your legs.  You seem to notice every feeling, every molecule of your body.  The way the garter straps are stretched tight against your thighs.  The way your skirt is pooled up on your back.  Even the way you can see down into your cleavage because of that missing button.  But most of all, you feel the cylinder behind you, nestled in the crack of your ass. You&#39;re uncomfortably aware that only the thin material of his pants and the thinner material of your panties keeps his monster from entering you.

&quot;God, I wish we were allowed to use you that way...&quot; he mutters.  He doesn&#39;t seem to even be talking to you anymore. &quot;Cause I could just...unbutton my pants...&quot;  You begin to weep as you feel him fumbling with the button on his pants. &quot;...pull them down...&quot;

Through tear filled eyes you see his pants pool around his ankles.  Oh GOD!!! He&#39;s going to rape you!

&quot;...I mean, I could just do it...and no one would know...YOU wouldn&#39;t tell anyone...&quot;

You can feel his silky boxer shorts against your bare skin...and worse, you can feel the warmth underneath that silk.  The large, cylindrical warmth that is growing and throbbing against you.

&quot;I could just...&quot; The beast breaks free of its cage and pushes against you. You whimper, struggling helplessly against your bonds.

&quot;Shhh,&quot; he whispers.  He leans forward ever so slightly and you feel him pressing your panties into your ass. &quot;...just this once...not all the way...just the tip...I&#39;ll only stick the tip in...&quot;

His fingers snake into the waist of your panties and you sob as he begins to slide them down.  You thrash against the belt holding your arms and wiggle furiously trying to manuever the thing aimed at your ass away from you.

It works and as your panties slide down, the monster behind you does too, slipping in between your legs.  Your long limbs wrap around the meaty beast tightly.  You try to pull your thighs apart, away from the intruder, but the belt keeps them firmly secured together.  You can feel it throbbing against your bare skin as he begins to slide in and out of the crevice that your legs have formed.  He moans behind you, building the speed of his thrusts, his body pounding against you, his dick drooling enough to lubricate his motion.  You feel it building, getting bigger and angrier and then...

...

Both of you are stone still as the ramifications of what just transpired sinks in.  Then he pulls away!

&quot;You almost got me.  That ass of yours almost tempted me into jeopordizing my position here, bitch,&quot; he says as he releases the belt.  You stand up slowly, wincing as his gooey mess runs down your thighs. &quot;I was THIS close to taking you...risking my job just for a piece of this...&quot; he smacks your sore ass, giving it a squeeze at the same time.  You whimper from the pain.

He yanks the spank-me sign off your back and throws it in the trash.

&quot;Don&#39;t think this lets you off the hook, bitch,&quot; he growls, &quot;I just don&#39;t want anyone else groping that ass of yours.  From now on, it belongs to me!&quot;  He starts for his office, and then stops.

&quot;I&#39;m not interested in guys, you know...&quot; he says looking at you with a gleam in his eye, &quot;But then again...you sure ain&#39;t a guy now, are ya? Clean yourself up and get to work, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.&quot;  The door to his office slams shut and you&#39;re left alone. 

Sniffling, you teeter over to the box of tissues on the end table next to the couch.  First you blot the tears from your face and then you set to work, cleaning between your legs.  The slimy stuff didn&#39;t stain your outfit...at least, nothing visible, but you can still feel the heat of his member between your legs even as you pull the stupid &lt;&lt;print $panty_color&gt;&gt; panties back on. You won&#39;t admit it, not to yourself or anyone else...ever...but you know that some of the slime between your legs...is yours...


[[Click here to continue.|sit_at_desk]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="124" name="sit_at_desk" tags="" position="475,1600">You plop down at the desk eager to get off the teetering heels, only to wince as your abused bottom connects roughly with the chair.  You wiggle around, trying to get comfortable.  Its not possible.  This chair is just like the ones in the training room, with the wedge running through the center that rides up your butt-crack.  Your skirt instantly slides up to reveal your thigh and you pull it back down again. 

Your eyes are drawn to a mirror that&#39;s bolted to the desk.  It&#39;s pointed directly at your face so that you can&#39;t help but see yourself as you sit there.  Despite the tears that you have shed throughout the day, there is no obvious distress to your make-up.  However they applied it, seems to be waterproof!  How are you ever going to get this stuff off!?!

Your eyes lock onto the eyes of the reflection and you shiver.  You&#39;re beautiful.  There&#39;s no other word for it.  Your skin is flawless, your long, &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; hair perfectly styled and your kissable &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; lips are large and pouty.  Another tear drips down your reflection&#39;s cheek and it only adds to the appeal.  She looks so helpless.  So submissive.  It can&#39;t possibly be you, can it?

There&#39;s a rustle behind the inner door and your heart begins to pound.  You need to get busy.  Maybe later there will be a good chance to escape, but for now, your best hope is to do the job well enough to avoid punishment.  You glance at the computer.  It&#39;s dark except for a single line which reads: &quot;Type in your name:&quot;

Not knowing what else to expect, you pull out the keyboard and start to type.

You wince as you type in &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  Everytime they make you use that horrible, degrading name it feels easier and easier.  After your typing lessons earlier, your fingers have no trouble finding the letters.  You stare at the name for a moment before pressing the Enter key.  &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  You.

&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  The girl in the mirror.  You.

The following words and phrases are allowed and can be used together:
Yes.
Sir.
Ma&#39;am.
Miss.
Please.
Thank you.
You&#39;re welcome.
I&#39;m sorry.

The following phrases are allowed.
Hello.
My name is &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.
How may I make your day better?
What else may I do for you?
I would be happy to.

Since most entry level girls are often confused and easily distracted, you may ask questions so long as:
1.You begin every question with the words &#39;May I&#39;.
2.You ask permission to ask the question by saying, &#39;May I ask a question?&#39;.

This is going too far.

You should always arch your back and be proud of your bust.  Your chest should be the first thing to enter a room and you should seek to draw attention to it in any way you can.

You should always wiggle when you walk.  Your hips should sway from side to side and you should always have a bounce in your step.  A bouncy girl is an energized girl.

You should always bend at the waist and you should NEVER bend your knees while bending over.  Proper posture is essential in this organization.

You should show your panties at every opportunity.  Panties are some of M&amp;R&#39;s best selling products and like all product placement, the more they are seen the better they sell.

You should keep your hands behind your back when standing still. Your arms should be crossed and your palms should be facing out.  This will help you not only to stand up straight, but also to arch your back and show off your bust.

You should keep your head bowed and your eyes down, unless a Manager is speaking to you.  A humble girl is a girl who knows her place.

You stop reading.  You can&#39;t believe you&#39;re actually sitting in an office, dressed as a beautiful woman, being forced to learn how to act as sexy as possible.  How did this happen?

You slip into the office and stand in front of her desk, waiting to see what indignity this place has in store for you next.  Without looking up from the what she&#39;s doing, she growls at you.

&quot;Have you learned nothing?&quot;

&quot;Wha...&quot; You don&#39;t even get the full word out.

&quot;When you come in here, you curtsey,&quot; she yells, &quot;Even an air-headed slut of a girl like you should be able to figure that out...Well???&quot; She looks up at you expectantly.  You glare back at her.  They may be able to dress you up like this and treat you like a bimbo, but you&#39;ll be damned if you&#39;re going to go along with it.

&quot;So you want this to be difficult then, do you?&quot; she says, a cruel smirk appearing on her face.  You may have made another mistake.  Her hand dips into the drawer of her desk and when she stands up you see that she&#39;s holding a leather strap with a chain connected to it.  You turn around, trying to run out of the office.  You don&#39;t make it to the door, before the woman slips the leather ring around your upper body and cinches it.  The leather circle fastens your arms to your body at the elbows and try as you might you can&#39;t get it off.  She jerks hard on the chain connected to the strap in the middle of your back and you go flying backwards, barely keeping your balance in the heels.  You turn around to see her climbing up on the back of the leather-bound chair facing her desk.  She attaches the chain to a hook on the ceiling, and then ratchets it in until you have only enough slack to move a foot in any direction.  She climbs down and gives your cheek a rough pinch.

&quot;There,&quot; she says wiping her hands off, &quot;We will now begin curtsey training.  When you have proven to me that you know how to curtsey and when to, then I will release you.  Until then...&quot;

She dips her hand into the desk drawer again and pulls out a leather switch.  For twenty minutes she instructs you on the proper way of curtseying.  With your arms strapped to your sides at the elbow, you are allowed just the right amount of arm freedom to lift your dress.  The chain also has just enough slack in it to instruct you on the proper amount of bob.  With every failed curtsey, she swats you with the switch.  In just twenty minutes, you have absolutely no doubt that you will curtsey every time you are supposed to.

When she releases you from the curtsey harness, you&#39;re told to go back to your desk and wait for three minutes.  Then to come in and try again.  For three minutes you sit at your desk, fighting back the tears of indignity and knowing that from now on, you will perform that stupid feminine curtsey at every opportunity.

You awkwardly do a bob, trying your best not to fall over in the heels.  Miss Worthington doesn&#39;t even seem to notice.  Her attention is riveted at the paper on her desk.

You stand there awkwardly unsure of what to say or do.  After an eternity passes, she finally looks up at you.

&quot;What!?!&quot; she asks.  Before you can stammer an answer her eyes drift to the printer, &quot;Oh...your test...let&#39;s see how you did, shall we?&quot;

She pulls the test out of the tray and takes a look at it.

You wince at the name.  By answering the questions right, she thinks you&#39;ve accepted what they&#39;ve done to you.  Maybe it&#39;ll make it easier to escape later, but right now it&#39;s just horribly humiliating.  You realize that she&#39;s staring at you.

&quot;Well?&quot; she asks, her voice no longer filled with praise, &quot;I complimented you &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  What do you do when I compliment you?&quot;

With your head hung in perfect submission, you perform a perfect curtsey.  Your face burns red at the indignity.

&quot;&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;...I just complimented you...When you&#39;re complimented you&#39;re supposed to...&quot; 

You blush, instantly dropping into a curtsey.  This is SO humiliating!

&quot;Excellent!  You&#39;re learning!  I think your punishment will be a simple chore to reinforce the lessons you have learned today, don&#39;t you think?&quot;

You start to give her a suggestion of what SHE can go and do, when you see her hand dip into her desk drawer.

She raises to her feet and when you see what&#39;s in her hand, you scream.  Even in your horror, you&#39;re dismayed to hear the girlishness to your cry.  You run for the door and try to get it open, but before you can, her arm locks around you.

&quot;Please don&#39;t...&quot; you whimper, even as she pulls your skirt up.  You feel the cold air of the room cause your bare thighs to pimple with gooseflesh and then...

&quot;You just need to be a little more receptive, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; she says.  She plunges the needle into the fatty part of your behind and you cry out in fear and pain as she injects a creamy liquid into you. &quot;That&#39;s why the job is called a receptionist...You need to be receptive.&quot;

You back a couple of steps away as she gets close, but the closed door behind you, blocks your retreat.  She presses up against you, her warm body pressing you against the door.  For a moment you think she&#39;s going to kiss you, but her lips travel to the side of your face to right beside your ear.

&quot;Listen very carefully,&quot; she whispers, her hand sliding up into your long, &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; hair, &quot;You are NOT a man...&quot;

She pulls down on your hair and your whole head slams backward into the door.  You cry out in pain and try to get away, put the woman has you pinned.  She yanks on your hair again and you scream.  She has her hand in a fist right at your scalp and every move sets fire to the top of your head.

&quot;You are a slutty, little girl,&quot;she whispers again even as tears fill your eyes, &quot;You may not have breasts...yet...and you may still have that poor excuse for a dick between your legs...for now...but look...&quot;

She drags you by the hair over to the ornate mirror hanging on the wall.  With one hand still entangled in your infernal long hair, the other hand grabs your cheeks and forces you to look into the mirror.

&quot;Does anything in this mirror suggest that you&#39;re a man?&quot; she barks, &quot;Well!?!&quot;

You don&#39;t answer.  You can&#39;t.  Nothing in the mirror would even hint that you weren&#39;t a beautiful, if slightly air-headed, young girl.  Her hands drop away and still you can&#39;t stop looking at the crying girl in the mirror.  How can that be you?  &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; she says moving to her desk, &quot;I have something that is going to make this whole thing a little easier for you.&quot;

It takes a second for your brain to process what she said and when it does, you turn to look at her with alarm.  In her hand she holds a hypodermic needle filled with a creamy looking fluid.  You scream and make a break for the door.  You don&#39;t make it.

She slams you up against the closed door and pins you against it.

&quot;Please don&#39;t...&quot; you whimper, even as she pulls your skirt up.  You feel the cold air of the room cause your bare thighs to pimple with gooseflesh and then...

You don&#39;t feel any different, but who knows what foul thing just got injected into your ass?

The two of you stand there a minute, her pinning you with her body against the closed door.  You feel her hand massaging your backside and you realize its sore not just from the spankings now but from the shot too.  A tear trickles down your cheek.  Why are they doing this to you!?!  You don&#39;t want to be this slutty, little sex-pot that they&#39;ve turned you into.  But everything you try to do to fix the situation only makes things worse!  What are you going to do?

You feel her hand slide around your hip and her fingers begin to trace the edges of the chastity belt.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, sweetie,&quot; she says softly into your ear, &quot;That was for your own good.  It&#39;ll just make you a little more...submissive.&quot; 

Another tear trickles down.  She catches it on your cheek with a kiss.  Her fingers move between your legs, rubbing the crotch of the chastity belt.  Your body responds despite your mind&#39;s horror of the situation.  Her finger finds the tiny hole in the belt and as if it were a button connected to the pleasure sensors in your brain, you moan.  Your member throbs inside of its confinement and squirts helplessly even as she continues to rub that sensitive spot.  Your whole body aches with need.  Your mind feels fuzzy and you KNOW that if you could just get a sexual release everything would seem a lot clearer, but with the belt on you will NEVER get that release.

&quot;Are you more...receptive...now, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;?&quot; she asks.  You moan again, unable to help yourself.  She chuckles and suddenly the rubbing stops.  She pulls away and goes back to her desk.  The whole world feels far away as you turn to look at her.  Your legs feel weak and every movement you make seems to stimulate your frustrated prisoner down below.


[[Click here to continue.|female_punishment1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="148" name="female_punishment1" tags="" position="975,1850">&quot;Now you are going to take twenty minutes and clean up my office.  There is a trash chute on the wall by your desk, take out my two waste baskets and yours as well.  Then in the bottom drawer of your desk, there are cleaning supplies.  I want this place to sparkle.  And remember, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;, You have to clean like an M&amp;R girl.  Bend at the waist and show off those pretty little panties of yours every chance you get, all right?  Because if you don&#39;t...&quot; she holds a wooden ruler and cracks it down hard on the desk.

And that&#39;s how you find yourself cleaning for twenty minutes.  You empty the waste-baskets, bending at the waist like a good little girl.  You wash the windows, stretching up on your tip-toes to reach the top, painfully aware of your skirt riding up.  You dust every inch of furniture.

With the room sparkling clean you stand submissively in front of her desk.  Your hands are behind your back, your chest is out, your head is down. She looks at you with a gleam in her eye.

&quot;All clean?&quot; she asks.

&quot;Yes Ma&#39;am,&quot; you hear yourself replying even as your body performs a curtsey.  You know you shouldn&#39;t act this way, but what choice do you have?  You have to get out of here somehow...if only an opportunity would present itself.


[[Click here to continue.|female_candy]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="149" name="female_candy" tags="" position="1100,1850">&quot;Wonderful,&quot; she says, clapping her hands, &quot;I believe you deserve a reward...&quot;

Her hand dips into the drawer of her desk and comes out holding something.  Your eyes widen.  She&#39;s giving you a lollipop shaped just like a...

&quot;There you go, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; she says, thrusting the phallic candy into your hand, &quot;Wrap your lips around that.  All the girls around here REALLY like them.&quot;

She looks at you expectantly and not knowing what to do, you curtsey again.

&quot;Yes...You&#39;re coming along just fine,&quot; she chuckles, &quot;Now go on and eat your reward.&quot;  You look at the candy in your hands again.  It&#39;s a life-size, red penis on a stick, maybe six-inches long and covered in a plastic wrapper.  She can&#39;t honestly expect you to put this in your mouth, can she?  I mean, you&#39;re a guy!  She KNOWS you&#39;re a guy!  You look up at her with questioning eyes only to see a big, smirk on her face.

&quot;Oh that&#39;s right,&quot; she cackles, &quot;I forgot.  You&#39;ve never had your lips wrapped around something shaped like that before, have you?&quot;  She moves over to you while she talks, grabbing the candy out of your hands. &quot;It&#39;s easy, see?&quot; she unwraps the lollipop and shoves it into your mouth.  Before you have time to react, she pushes you down onto the leather-bound chair facing her desk and climbs on top of you.  Her knees lock your arms down next to you and her weight makes it impossible for you to get out of the chair.  One of her arms wraps around your head, while the other continues to hold onto the base of the candy cock.

&quot;The real secret to enjoying this candy is to savor it,&quot; she says.  She pushes the candy all the way into your mouth.  You start to gag, but before you can she pulls it back out, so that the head of the fake dick rests squarely on your tongue.  Then she pushes it back in again.  You bite down, trying to crack the thing in half and keep her from molesting your mouth with it, but the thing is too hard and thick to break.  You only succeed in hurting your teeth.  You try to struggle to get away, but with her weight on top of you, you have no options.  Uncomfortably aware of the shape of the thing in your mouth, you stop resisting and allow her to slide the candy in and out of your lips.

&quot;Now I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll like the real thing better,&quot; she whispers into your ear, her voice causing the hairs on your neck to stand up, &quot;but this one is better for you.  Filled with all the vitamins and nutrients a young girl like you needs.&quot;  Your eyes widen.  For the first time you realize that the candy has a medicinal taste to it.  Is it drugged?  And if so, with what?

She continues to torment you with the candy for fifteen minutes while she whispers disgusting tips on how to savor the cock in your mouth, until finally you&#39;re able to bite into the beast.  She laughs and climbs off of you, squeezing your neck affectionately before she leaves. 

&quot;You&#39;ve got a great looking mouth, girl.  I may have to try it out for myself later.&quot;

You&#39;re about to spit the candy out when you see Miss Worthington glare up at you, just waiting for you to do something wrong.  Your butt still throbs in a reminder of what happens for disobedience and that makes the decision for you.  Wincing at the thought of what chemicals or drugs might be in the sweet tasting chunks, you chew up the remains and swallow them.  Hopefully its nothing bad!

You turn to look at her, outraged over her molesting your mouth that way when you see her smile and wave at the door.  You whip around, your skirt twirling to reveal your stocking tops only to see two women and a man standing in the doorway staring at you.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, sweetie,&quot; he says softly into your ear, &quot;That was for your own good.  It&#39;ll just make you a little more...feminine...a little more...submissive.&quot; 

Another tear trickles down.  He catches it on your cheek with a kiss.  You feel him press up against you, grinding his crotch against your exposed ass.

&quot;Not that you need much help.  You&#39;re too hot for your own good.&quot; You feel a throb against your ass and you whimper.  The soft chuckle he makes frightens you more than you&#39;ve ever been frightened before.

&quot;Let&#39;s see how you&#39;re doing,&quot; he says and turns you around to face him.  

His lips hit yours and before you realize what has happened his tongue has slid into your mouth.  He&#39;s kissing you!  You try to fight but find that your body doesn&#39;t exactly respond right away.  You don&#39;t feel drugged, but you feel distant...passive...as if you&#39;re watching a movie.  Your brain continues trying to analyze this situation while Mr. Elliot continues to explore your tonsils. 

You&#39;re overly analytical brain registers the fact that what he&#39;s doing feels good.  As he presses tighter up against you, Your whole body aches with need.  Your mind feels fuzzy and you KNOW that if you could just get a sexual release everything would seem a lot clearer, but with the belt on you will NEVER get that release.

He breaks the kiss and for a moment you miss it.  Then you&#39;re horrified at that thought.

&quot;Are you more...receptive...now, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;?&quot; he asks.  You hear a soft moan and you wonder if the noise came from you.  He chuckles and moves back to her desk.  The whole world feels far away as you turn to look at him.  Your legs feel weak and every movement you make seems to stimulate your frustrated prisoner down below.

There is a trash chute on the wall by your desk, take out my two waste baskets and yours as well.  Then in the bottom drawer of your desk, there are cleaning supplies.  I want this place to sparkle.  And remember, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;, You have to clean like an M&amp;R girl.  Bend at the waist and show off that sexy little ass of yours every chance you get, all right?  Because if you don&#39;t...&quot; he holds a wooden ruler and cracks it down hard on the desk.

You clean for twenty minutes.  You empty the waste-baskets, bending at the waist like a good little girl.  You wash the windows, stretching up on your tip-toes to reach the top, painfully aware of your skirt riding up and yelping as he gooses you.  You dust every inch of furniture.

With the room sparkling clean you stand submissively in front of his desk.  Your hands are behind your back, your chest is out, your head is down. He looks at you with a gleam in his eye.

&quot;All clean?&quot; he asks.

&quot;Yes Sir,&quot; you hear yourself replying even as your body performs a curtsey.  You know you shouldn&#39;t act this way, but what choice do you have?  You have to get out of here somehow...if only an opportunity would present itself.


[[Click here to continue.|male_candy]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="158" name="male_candy" tags="" position="975,1975">&quot;Perfect.&quot; he says, a grin touching the corner of his mouth, &quot;In fact...you deserve a reward.&quot; The tone in his voice makes you not want whatever it is he has planned.

&quot;Come here,&quot; he says, sitting in his chair and patting his legs.  Dear God!  You know what that means.  He wants you to sit on his lap!  You delay just long enough to see a flash of anger in his eyes and then before you even know that you&#39;re going to do it, you rush over and sit down on his lap.  You put your arm around his neck and adjust yourself just as Mr. Kail taught you.  You feel one of his hands on your back, helping to support you and and you breath a sigh of relief when his other hand doesn&#39;t go on your leg.

And then you see what&#39;s in his other hand.

&quot;Wrap those hot little lips of yours around this, cutie,&quot; he says handing you the lollipop.  You stare at it in disbelief.  It&#39;s shaped just like a...

&quot;Go on, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;, unwrap it.  All the girls around here love them!&quot;

You look at the candy in your hands again.  It&#39;s a life-size, red penis on a stick, maybe six-inches long and covered in a plastic wrapper.  He can&#39;t honestly expect you to put this in your mouth, can he?  I mean, you&#39;re a guy!  He KNOWS you&#39;re a guy!  You look up at him with questioning eyes only to see a big, smirk on his face.

&quot;Here,&quot; he says pulling the plastic off the candy, &quot;Let me help you.&quot;

His hand wraps around yours and slowly brings the head of the lollipop up to your lips.&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; he says softly, &quot;Kiss it first and then slowly...&quot; He presses your hand up and forces the candy between your lips.  It knocks against your teeth with a click.

&quot;Good.  You&#39;re doing fine...Now open your mouth...&quot; You shake your head slightly.  He can&#39;t...he can&#39;t make you do this!  You know its only a piece of candy, but the way he&#39;s talking, the way he&#39;s sliding it into your mouth...

The hand on yours squeezes hard and you yelp in pain.  He takes the opportunity to push your hand upward and slide the phallic candy between your teeth.  You try to bite down on it, to end this horrible pseudo-sexual game, but it&#39;s too big and too hard.  Your teeth begin to hurt.  You try to pull it out of your mouth, but another hard squeeze on your hand drains all the resistence out of you.  He pushes the candy cock all the way into your mouth until you gag a little, and then lets your hand have just enough freedom to let you pull it back out.  He pushes it back in, deeper this time and you think you&#39;re going to vomit, but once again he let&#39;s you slide it back out again before you do.

&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; he says, his voice distant as if he isn&#39;t aware that he&#39;s talking, &quot;In and out.  Keep going.&quot;

After three more cycles he lets his hand drop from yours down to your leg.  You start to pull it out of your mouth, but his vice-like grip grabs your knee and you instantly start sliding the thing in and out of your mouth again.  You look over at his face and you can actually see your reflection in his eyes.  It sends a shiver up your spine.  Here you are, sitting on this man&#39;s lap, dressed as the sexiest, most provocative woman you&#39;ve ever seen, sliding a candy penis in and out of your mouth.

&quot;Try to push it all the way in, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; he says his hand beginning to rub your leg, &quot;All the way...&quot;

You feel a bulge pressing up under your leg and you feel like screaming.  His hand is traveling north as well, sliding up under your skirt to the bare skin above the stockings, even as you slide the candy up into your gag reflex again.

&quot;God you make a great woman,&quot; he mumbles.  His whole hand is on bare flesh now, his thumb sliding between your thighs. &quot;It&#39;s almost sexier that this is all new to you.  The girls we get put up a fight sometimes, but they&#39;ve all experimented a little...but you...&quot;

You don&#39;t like the way this is going.  You try to bite down on the candy again and recieve a painful pinch on your thighs.

&quot;Uh-uh...No biting,&quot; he chuckles, &quot;Just in and out.  Use that tongue of yours on it...go on...&quot;

Without warning he swivels you around on his lap so that you&#39;re sitting on him like a chair.  You almost gag yourself with the horrible candy as he pulls you back forcing your legs to open.  To straddle his.  You feel the bulge in his pants, grow and throb as it stabs against your backside.  You look down as you continue to slide the candy in and out of your mouth and see that your skirt has been forced up.  Your bare thighs are glowing against his legs, and his hand has snuck down to rest so that the side of it is against your crotch.  This has gone too far!

You try to get up off his lap, but the hand on your leg pins you down, while his other hand slides around to cup your right breast.

&quot;God, they even feel real,&quot; he says into your ear, his voice causing the hairs to stand up, &quot;Don&#39;t stop...in and out...You don&#39;t want to be a cock-tease, do you?&quot; You shake your head before realizing that even though you don&#39;t want to be a cock-tease, you don&#39;t want to be what he wants either.  His fingers begin sliding up and down against your panties and despite the chastity belt you&#39;re suddenly aware that you&#39;re locked away member is crying out in agony.  You squirm as he continues to rub, not wanting it to feel good, but not being able to stop it.  Even the candy that you&#39;re sliding in and out of your mouth has begun to feel sexy.  For the love of God, he&#39;s turning you on and you can&#39;t get away!

You feel the lump underneath you swell to astronomical proportions and the thought flickers through your brain that he is so much larger than the candy in your mouth.

&quot;You like that don&#39;t you?&quot; he whispers in your ear, continuing to rub harder and harder between your legs.  You squirm more which only stimulates the beast throbbing underneath you.  &quot;Maybe later...you can try wrapping your lips around...something else...&quot;

Your eyes go wide in horror and surprise.  At the same time liquid squirts uncontrollably into your panties.  There&#39;s no sense of relief, no sense of having orgasmed, but just a wet and still sexually-frustrated longing between your legs.  You realize that you&#39;ve stopped sucking on the lollipop.  You have in fact bitten it off the stick and into three pieces. You crunch them up trying to keep them from sliding down your throat and choking you, all the while Mr. Elliot chuckles in your ear.

&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll like the real thing better,&quot; he whispers into your ear, his voice causing the hairs on your neck to stand up, &quot;but this one is better for you.  Filled with all the vitamins and nutrients a young girl like you needs.&quot;  Your eyes widen.  For the first time you realize that the taste in your mouth has a medicinal quality to it.  Was it drugged?  And if so, with what? Not that there&#39;s anything you can do about now, the big pieces have already been swallowed and the little ones are practically liquified. The hand on your leg squeezes.

&quot;Well? Aren&#39;t you going to say hello?&quot;

You don&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about and then your gaze travels to the door.  A man is leaning in the doorframe, smirking at the two of you.  And with good reason.  You&#39;re straddling a man&#39;s legs, grinding your ass into his crotch, with your skirt hiked up.  His hands are on your breast and between your legs and the smile on Mr. Elliot&#39;s face says that he&#39;s having a fine time, indeed.

&quot;Am I interrupting something?&quot; the man in the doorway asks with a smug chuckle.

&quot;Not at all,&quot; Mr. Elliot says, &quot;In fact, you&#39;re just in time.&quot;


[[Click here for chapter 4!|m4_start][$score_sub += 1, $image_name = &#39;renee&#39;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="159" name="m4_start" tags="" position="1100,1975">&quot;Well?&quot; Mr. Elliot says smacking your ass and dumping you off his lap.  You squeal and totter on the heels, flapping your arms like a bird trying to regain your balance.  The men chuckle at your distress.

&quot;So I see you got yourself a new toy, John?&quot; the man in the doorway says.  He walks over to you, a wolfish grin spreading across his face, &quot;Brand new too, from the look in her eyes.&quot;  You back away from his approach.  This can&#39;t be happening!  The horrible Mr. Elliot was bad enough and now there are two...both of them looking at you like you&#39;re a present they&#39;d like to unwrap.  You feel your backside press up against the wall and still he approaches, bursting into your personal space as if he owns it.

He presses against you, his body overwhelming compared to yours.  You want to scream but you know it will do no good.  You&#39;re a prisoner in this place.  Completely at the whim of both of these horrible men.

&quot;A little small on top,&quot; the brute says, his hand cupping your right breast, &quot;But that&#39;s easily fixable.  And with her figure, some big tits would make her a knockout.&quot;  You can actually feel your knees knocking together.  The beast rubbing up against you is talking about giving you breasts!  You&#39;ve got to get out this madhouse before its too late!

&quot;Yeah she needs a little work,&quot; Mr. Elliot says from his desk, &quot;And more training too.  But there is something special about this one...&quot;  He winks at you and you cringe at the reference to your true gender.  If this other brute had any clue that you weren&#39;t a woman...

&quot;&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;! Get Mr. Pendlar a drink!&quot;

Mr. Pendlar backs a step away from you letting you slither out from under his thumb.  Not knowing what else to do, you curtsey at the order.  They don&#39;t even seem to notice your obedience.  They only pay attention when you do something wrong.  It just isn&#39;t fair!

&quot;Scotch on the rocks, girl,&quot; Mr Pendlar says, plopping down into the chair facing Mr. Elliot&#39;s desk.  You curtsey again.  This is SO demeaning.  Having to do this little dance everytime you are spoken to.

&quot;Vodka martini for me, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;, Mr. Elliot says, &quot;With a twist.&quot;

God!  You&#39;re supposed to be a waitress too?  You curtsey at his order.  Then the thought hits you.  Where are you supposed to get drinks?

You gaze at Mr. Elliot helplessly, biting your lip with trepidation.  You can see the look of annoyance in his eyes at your delayed action...but what are you to do?

&quot;The bar, girl,&quot; he growls, pointing to the corner of the room.  Your eyes follow his finger and tucked into the wall is a tiny minibar.  You breathe a sigh of relief and scamper over to it.

Scotch on the rocks.  Piece of cake.  You plop some ice into a glass and cover them with the expensive looking scotch.  Then you hesitate.  A martini?  Uh-oh.  You know its vodka and vermouth...but how much of each?

You try to adjust it, but before you can, one of Mr. Elliot&#39;s fingers slides into your mouth.  You instantly taste the alcohol on it and realize he&#39;s making you taste your concoction.  You don&#39;t dare bite him.  Not while sitting on his lap, dressed like this with his buddy watching the whole thing.  With no alternative, you let your lips form an &#39;O&#39; around his finger.  You feel the heavy, meaty thing on your tongue and instantly want to gag.  Why do they keep putting things in your mouth around here?

&quot;See?&quot; Mr. Elliot says, sliding his finger in and out of your mouth twice, &quot;Now go...make it the right way!&quot; He smacks your ass AGAIN and you squeal, leaping to your feet.

Humiliated, you scamper over to the bar to make another martini.  You don&#39;t have the top off the vodka before you feel him press up behind you.

&quot;Let me help you,&quot; Mr. Pendlar says, grinding up against your behind.  His arms wrap around you, grabbing the bottle that you&#39;re holding.  He helps you pour in the appropriate amount of vodka and then the dash of vermouth.  You begin to shake the concoction, uncomfortably aware of how much it makes you jiggle against him.  You try to shake more gently, reducing your wiggling.  It backfires.

&quot;You need to shake it harder than that &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  Here...I&#39;ll hold these for you!&quot;

His hands snake up to your breasts.  He cups them, holding them steady as you bounce.  You feel like crying as you shake the martini as hard as you can.  Your rear end can&#39;t help but rub against his crotch and you feel the reaction immediately.  You shake harder, trying to get the thing done so you can stop this horrible encounter.  He releases you and steps away as you pour the drink into the glass. You realize that you are holding your breath and gratefully let it out.  You turn around with the glass, aware that he is still standing a little too close.

&quot;What?  No thank you?&quot; he asks with a smirk.  The bastard wants you to thank him for feeling you up!

Grimacing, you curtsey for the brute, muttering a polite &#39;thank you&#39; before scampering back over to Mr. Elliot.

&quot;See,&quot; he says to Mr. Pendlar, &quot;She still needs some training.

&quot;Well that should be fun,&quot; Mr. Pendlar laughs.  Mr. Elliot joins him, both of them leering at you chuckling.  This can&#39;t be good sign.

&quot;She definately needs a bigger rack though,&quot; Mr. Pendlar says.  Your hands instinctively go up to cover the mounds on your chest as if your fingers can protect these beasts from implanting stuff into your chest.  Mr. Elliot winks at you again, aware of your discomfort.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Mr. Elliot says, &quot;She&#39;s almost as flat-chested as a guy!&quot;  Mr. Pendlar chuckles again at this, as if the idea of you as a guy is the funniest thing he&#39;s ever heard.  You wonder for a minute if you have stopped blushing since you walked into this building this morning.  Mr. Elliot winks at you again.  The bastard is enjoying your discomfort.  How can he be doing this to you?  He knows you&#39;re a guy and he&#39;s talking about giving you breast implants!!!

&quot;Payne asked me what size I think she should have,&quot; Mr. Elliot says, &quot;But I told her I&#39;d have to think about it.  Like I said...&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt; is special.&quot;

&quot;I say give her big ones.&quot; Mr. Pendlar says, cupping his hands out a full foot in front of his chest, &quot;Like an F or a G or something.&quot;

Your eyes boggle out of your head.  They wouldn&#39;t.  They couldn&#39;t...

&quot;Nah, nothing bigger than Double D&#39;s I think,&quot; Mr. Elliot says as if that&#39;s any better, &quot;We don&#39;t want her so top heavy she falls over!&quot;  They both laugh again.

&quot;Please no...&quot; you hear yourself squeak, &quot;Please...&quot;

They both turn to look at you, they&#39;re lips pulled up in cruel smirks.  Then Mr. Pendlar stands up.

&quot;Well I believe that a woman&#39;s breast size is directly proportional to her IQ.  The dumber she is, the bigger breasts she needs to have.&quot;

He walks over to you and smacks your rump again.  You squeal, but hold your position.  After all, where do you have to go?

&quot;Well if that&#39;s true,&quot; Mr. Elliot chuckles, &quot;Do they make anything bigger than a G?&quot;

You glare at him angrily.  You&#39;re not stupid.  They just don&#39;t explain anything right around here!

&quot;I propose a test,&quot; Mr. Pendlar says, smacking your rear end again.  This time his hand stays there and squeezes.  You can&#39;t help but squeal softly as he gooses you. &quot;A series of challenges.  Each one she fails adds a cup size.&quot;

What?  He can&#39;t be serious.  You turn to look at Mr. Elliot waiting for him to put a stop to this nonsense.

&quot;I think that&#39;s an excellent idea.&quot; he says grinning, &quot;But no more than three challenges.  The poor girl isn&#39;t too smart.  If we keep adding cup sizes to those little A-cups of hers, she&#39;ll end up with breasts bigger than that empty head of hers.&quot;

They both laugh again as you stare at them in horror.  A test to determine if you get implants?  This is insane.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="168" name="m4_stay_there" tags="" position="975,2100">You stand there motionless, with your head down, trying to be as unnoticeable as possible.  You don&#39;t dare move.  You don&#39;t know what to do.  So you stand there, in the uncomfortable heels, trying to blend into the wall.

Suddenly you realize that their conversation has stopped.

&quot;Don&#39;t you have anything to do?&quot; Mr. Elliot growls.  You shake your head, trembling.

&quot;I can think of some things,&quot; Mr. Pendlar says waggling his eyebrows.

You curtsey and plop yourself across his lap, aware that his hand falls much higher up than your knee. &quot;Let&#39;s see how smart you are.&quot;

Mr. Pendlar smirks at this.  He obviously thinks you&#39;re just like the rest of the air-headed bimbos around this place.  Well...you&#39;ll show him...

&quot;Now you obviously think your breasts are big enough, right &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;?&quot; he says, tickling your thigh with his fingers.  You nod your head enthusiastically adding a &quot;Yes sir&quot; for good measure.  You can&#39;t help but glance down at them as you nod and grimace at how even these little fake breasts stick out off your chest.

&quot;Challenge number one is to show Mr. Pendlar, just HOW much you like your breasts.  If you can convince him that they are good enough as they are, then you pass the first challenge.  If you can&#39;t...&quot; he puts his hands in front of your chest, indicating that they would be bigger.  Your mouth falls open.  

&quot;Well?  What are you waiting for?&quot;  

You stare at him, unsure what to do.  Show them that you like these fake atrocities?  How?

You look down at them, once again unable to not see the fake cleavage that your chest muscles have formed.  He can&#39;t possibly be serious about signing you up for implants!  This is insane!  They can&#39;t MAKE you have surgery, can they?  And even if they can, you plan on being out of this madhouse, long before they could schedule an operation.  Even so...best not to take any chances.

A pageant where the women are men...and where they are being held tightly on the lap of one of the judges.

There is a long pause as Mr. Pendlar just looks at you, then he shrugs.

&quot;Is that it?&quot; he asks, rolling his eyes.  He makes a buzzer sound and points a thumb down. &quot;She needs bigger tits desparately, John...and lessons on how to use them too.&quot;  The men laugh loudly and you squeal as Mr. Elliot squeezes your thigh a little too hard.  You feel his mouth tickle your ear and shiver.

&quot;They&#39;ll have perfect little nipples on them too...always sticking out to remind everyone what a horny, little slut you are.&quot;

His breath causes the hairs in your ear to stand on end and you wince as the thing between your legs squirts again.  How can you be turned on by what this brute is doing?

You look into Mr. Elliot&#39;s eyes and feel an icey fear fill your heart.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="172" name="m4_fondle" tags="" position="225,2225">You watch your hands with the long, &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; nails slowly raise up to your breasts.  Slowly you cup them, unable to keep from marveling at how real they feel.  You arch your back, letting your hands begin to slowly knead the soft mounds.  If you want to avoid this stupid implant idea, you need to make this look REAL convincing.  Mr. Elliot knows you&#39;re not a woman, but this new guy...he thinks your breasts are real!  You have no doubt it would be better for him to continue under that assumption and for him to know that you DON&#39;T want anything bigger on your chest.

You let your fingers slide inside your blouse and you feel the satiny material of the bra.  Down below, another squirt.  You rub the fake nipples poking through the material with your fingers and let a soft moan escape your lips.  There...that was pretty convincing.  You sneak a peak at Mr. Pendlar.  He&#39;s staring at you with a vacant expression.  What you&#39;re doing seems to be working.

You throw your head back and moan a little louder, kneading your breasts...pushing them tighter together.

Another squirt between your legs.  God!  You&#39;re doing this so convincingly that you&#39;re turning YOURSELF on!

You feel a hard lump forming underneath you, and you suddenly realize that you&#39;ve been feeling yourself up for a couple of minutes.  Blushing, your hands drop back down to your lap.  You smile sheepishly at Mr. Elliot who smirks at you.

&quot;Damn,&quot; mutters Mr. Pendlar, &quot;Even though I think she needs bigger tits, that was still pretty fucking hot.&quot;  He holds a thumb up.  &quot;I think she likes &#39;em just fine.&quot;

Hah!  You showed them!  You feel a surge of pride for a moment...at least until Mr. Elliot&#39;s mouth brushes against your ear.

&quot;If I didn&#39;t know better,&quot; he whispers, &quot;I&#39;d say you really DO like those fake little breasts of yours. And I think you&#39;d like REAL one&#39;s better.&quot; Your eyes go wide.  You passed the test.  He wouldn&#39;t...

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; he says, his hand massaging your leg, &quot;I&#39;ll play fair...we&#39;ll just see how well you do on the next one.&quot;


[[Click here to continue|m4_test2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="173" name="m4_grope" tags="" position="350,2225">A burst of inspiration strikes you and you grab Mr. Elliot&#39;s hand off your knee.  You press it to your left breast, putting your hand on top of it.  Your fingers, with the long, &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; nails interlock with his and you slowly begin to massage the fake mound on your chest with his hand.  You let out a moan worthy of an Academy Award, arching your back against his touch.  You feel his other hand slide down to your ass, and you squirm as he pinches you, grinding against the thing once again growing beneath you.  How do you keep ending up in this position!?!

After a few more fondles, his hand drops off your chest and back to your thigh.  You look at him for a second, at the smirky expression on his face, then turn to look at &#39;The Judge&#39;.

Mr. Pendlar just chuckles.

&quot;Well she obviously wants men to feel her up,&quot; he says, &quot;And she&#39;ll have a better chance of that if she&#39;s got a bigger cup size.  So...&quot; He makes a buzzer sound and points his thumb down.

Wait.  He can&#39;t mean...  But you...

You feel Mr. Elliot&#39;s mouth tickle against your ear.

As you scramble for balance you can&#39;t help but notice the tent in his pants.  You&#39;ve got to get out of this pervert&#39;s clutches!

&quot;Show Mr. Pendlar a part of your body that you think makes up for those little titties of yours.&quot;

You stare at him.  Just when you think things can&#39;t get any worse...

You rack your brains trying to think of what body part would convince these sadists that you don&#39;t need bigger breasts.  The ideas that come to mind are not pleasant.

But you know that&#39;s not the kind of body part that they&#39;re talking about...and even if it was, its locked up unable to serve as proof.  So what DO you have that is sexier than big breasts?

The answer hits you like a bolt of lightning!  You don&#39;t have breasts.  You don&#39;t have the right equipment between your legs.  But you do have...

You shiver as you think about what you&#39;ll have to do. But what choice do you really have!?!  Strut around and shake your ass in his face, or be put under the knife to get breasts!  There really ISN&#39;T a choice.

Taking a deep, not-so-steadying breath, you strut over in front of Mr. Pendlar.  You walk with one leg in front of the other, swinging your bottom from side to side as Ms. Payne taught you.  Its only as you turn around and present your backside to the horrible man judging you that you truly realize your position.  Seeing your ass through your skirt is not going to be enough for this brute.  What have you gotten yourself into!

Trembling from the embarrassment and the preassure, you slowly raise your skirt up, revealing your wet, &quot; + panty_color + &quot; panties to the man behind you.  You slide your hands back, feeling your smooth skin and cupping your cheeks with your manicured, &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; nails.  You can see from his expression, that it isn&#39;t enough.  Blushing as red as your beaten behind, you bend over at the waist, letting your hands touch the ground. You can see him through your legs, reaching his hand out and then you feel his caress.  Never have you been more grateful for the infernal panties crammed between your cheeks, as his hand explores your backside.

&quot;God!  I&#39;d give my first-born kid to get a piece of this!&quot; he says, tracing the center-line of your panties.  You can&#39;t help but pull away as his finger moves between your cheeks.

&quot;She does have a great ass, doesn&#39;t she?&quot; Mr. Elliot says, that horrible smirk on his face again, &quot;But what do you think?  Is it enough to justify those tiny tits of hers?&quot;

&quot;Nah!&quot; Mr. Pendlar says, smacking your abused behind once.  You leap forward away from the man, spinning to look at him in anger.  After all you went through he STILL thinks you need breasts? &quot;Her ass is great!  But if you&#39;re gonna take a woman that way, you need something to hold onto and SHE just ain&#39;t got those!&quot; You cover your breasts with your hands, horrified at what this man just said.  Take a woman that way?  Does he mean...

You tremble at the thought, unaware that Mr. Elliot has gotten up and come over to you.  He wraps his arms around you, his body pressing up against the part you just displayed.  You watch Mr. Pendlar adjust the tentpole in his pants, the one obviously caused by you, as Mr. Elliot whispers into your ear.

The answer hits you like a bolt of lightning!  With these blasted high-heeled shoes and the sleek, &lt;&lt;print $stockings&gt;&gt; stockings, you KNOW that your legs are to die for!  So now the only question is:  How do you show them off to these sick perverts!

You shiver as the mental image of what you have to do flashes into your head.  But what choice do you really have!?!  Strut around and show them that you have the best damn legs ever, or be put under the knife to get breasts!  There really ISN&#39;T a choice.

Taking a deep, not-so-steadying breath, you strut over in front of Mr. Pendlar.  You walk with one leg in front of the other, to fully emphasize them.  He notices at once, his gaze traveling down you to focus on the spot where your legs tuck into your skirt.

Feeling like a prisoner in your own body, you watch your hands grip the hem of your skirt and slowly lift it up to flash a teasing glimpse of thigh.  Its not enough!  You know its not enough!  What else can you do!  The fake breasts on your chest seem to get heavier as if implying that you&#39;re about to lose!  You&#39;re beginning to panic and your thinking brain shuts down.  They want a sexy show, so give them a sexy show!

You twirl, your skirt flaring up to show your wet, &quot; + panty_color + &quot; panties.  Then with your ass facing Mr. Pendlar, you bend over at the waist and slowly rub your hands up your silky left leg.  You watch his reaction with your eyes and see the growing tent forming in his pants.  You&#39;re on to something here!  Grinning with renewed self-confidence, you spin around again.  Your skirt sails high, swishing around your legs with abandon.  Now for the final touch.  You lift your foot and put it on the chair between Mr. Pendlar&#39;s legs.  You watch his hand go to it and shiver as he caresses your calf.  But if a feel of your leg keeps those implants out of your chest it&#39;ll be well worth it!

&quot;God! She moves like a stripper!&quot; Mr. Pendlar says, still feeling up your leg, &quot;But who would pay to see her with nothing up top!&quot;

Your eyes widen in disbelief.  All that and he still thinks you need breasts!  This just isn&#39;t fair.

You pull your leg away from him and sulk over to the corner of the room, much to the amusement of the two men.  Mr. Elliot gets up and walks over to you, wrapping his arms around you.  You watch Mr. Pendlar adjust the tentpole in his pants as Mr. Elliot whispers into your ear.

Then an idea dawns on you.  Summoning up all the courage you have, you pucker up your lips and blow the disgusting man a kiss.  You poof up your lips, letting them form into a sexy pout. He seems to get the idea.

&quot;She does have a sexy mouth, John,&quot; Mr. Pendlar says watching you intently.  You grin, your painted &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; lips breaking out into a smile. 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Mr. Elliot agrees,  &quot;But does she know how to use it?&quot;

Uh-oh!

&quot;Let&#39;s see,&quot; Mr. Pendlar says patting his legs, &quot;Come here darling.  Give me a kiss!&quot;

You want to run screaming from the room.  Everything you do around here, seems to end up with you sitting on a guy&#39;s lap doing something disgusting.  You look at the door longingly.  How can they have a door with no HANDLE?

Mr. Pendlar clears his throat and pats his legs again.  You can sense the spanking that would come if you hestitate any longer. Bobbing another ridiculous curtsey you teeter over to Mr. Pendlar and plop down across his lap.

He pulls you tightly against him, pressing you hard against his chest, then without wasting a second, his lips press down onto yours.  You can tell instantly he is not interested in a chaste kiss.  Your lower lip is sucked in between his and he nibbles lightly on it, before snaking his tongue into your mouth.  It hits your closed teeth like water against a dam sliding over them one way then the other.  You feel his hands begin to explore your body:  your legs, your breasts, your...

You gasp as his fingers slip between your legs finding that sensitive little opening in the chastity belt.  Your surprise allows his tongue access into the deeper recesses of your mouth.

&quot;Bite him&quot; your mind screams, &quot;Bite the disgusting thing off!&quot; But you don&#39;t.  Not only does the idea of his blood filling your mouth turn your stomach, but worse...the repercussions.  They&#39;ve beaten you at the drop of the hat so far...imagine if you did something TRULY bad!

His tongue continues to explore inside of you and without any other options, you allow yourself to be kissed.  The finger between your legs flicks incessantly at the pleasure spot and you squirm at the sensation, feeling your body begin to betray you yet again.  His finger quickens its motion and you hear yourself moan.  God, if you could only cum then maybe you could think straight enough to get out of this madhouse.  And you&#39;re SO close! If he just keeps...

His finger stops moving and you moan again, this time in disappointment.  You were SO close!

Desperately, you kiss him back, squeezing your thighs against his hand keeping it where it is.  It doesn&#39;t work.  His finger is motionless against your pleasure spot.  You squirm against his hand, but its just not the same!  Why won&#39;t he rub you?  You suck on his tongue, rubbing your hands all over his chest, begging him with your actions to please, just please finish you off!

Then, without warning, he breaks the kiss.  His hand pulls out from between your legs and you whimper in frustration.  You HAVE to get out of this chastity belt!  Its driving you mad!  You can&#39;t believe how slutty its making you act.  You just had your hands all over this man, just so he would rub your crotch!

As he dumps you off his lap, you can&#39;t help but notice that Mr. Pendlar is trembling.  Oh no!  Did he find out that you&#39;re really a guy!  You should never have let his hand get between your legs!

&quot;Damn!&quot; he mutters as if he&#39;s barely able to talk, &quot;The way she kisses, who gives a shit if she has breasts!  I almost needed a change of shorts!&quot;

Your face turns beet red as you turn to see the smirk on Mr. Elliot&#39;s face.  You won the challenge, but you also french-kissed a man so well that he almost came!

&quot;She is an eager, little slut, isn&#39;t she?&quot; Mr. Elliot asks, not needing an answer from the flustered Mr. Pendlar, &quot;All right.  So she wins this round.&quot; He walks over to you and wraps his arms around you from behind.  His lips tickle your ear in what might be a kiss as you hear the words, &quot;Final challenge...&quot;

For a second, you&#39;re relieved.  No disgusting task to perform.  Then the nature of the question sinks in.  You have to tell them why small breasts are bad, which is only going to convince Mr. Pendlar that you need bigger ones.  Yet if you don&#39;t tell them why they&#39;re bad, you&#39;ll fail the test and you&#39;ll be given bigger breasts.  This just isn&#39;t fair.

Hmm.  So THAT&#39;s how you get out.

&quot;Please...&quot; you beg, big tears running down your smooth cheeks, &quot;Please...don&#39;t do this...&quot;

&quot;Do what?&quot; he asks innocently.  His fingers fly across the keyboard typing in the diabolical email message.

&quot;This...any of this,&quot; you sob.  The flood gate has opened up inside of you and you can&#39;t seem to turn off the waterworks.  Why are you crying like this?  This isn&#39;t like you...

&quot;I don&#39;t want to be this...thing...you&#39;re turning me into.&quot;  Your fingers pluck at the short skirt...at the almost see through blouse... &quot;I don&#39;t...I don&#39;t want to be a woman.&quot;

&quot;You silly little tramp,&quot; he says.  His hands thankfully stop typing and instead, one caresses the side of your face. &quot;You&#39;re kneeling at my side, dressed like a slut and bawling like a baby.  You&#39;re not a WOMAN!  You&#39;re a girl...a slutty little girl that obviously doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s best for her.&quot;

You can&#39;t stop crying.  More tears run down your face and your breath catches in an embarrasingly girlie sob.  You can&#39;t help but wonder if it&#39;s being treated this way that&#39;s making you so emotional...or the drugs.  You can still taste that medicinal candy he fed you.  What are they turning you into???

His thumb wipes away a tear and you gaze up at him with mournful eyes.

&quot;...please...&quot; you mutter one last time.  He doesn&#39;t have time for a response.  The intercom beeps on his desk.

&quot;Mr. Elliot?&quot; says a sexy girl&#39;s voice on the other end, &quot;Mr. Martinez is on his way up.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Nikki,&quot; Mr Elliot buzzes back.  Then his gaze travels back to you.  You sniffle, your tears cried out.  You&#39;re suddenly aware of how you must look.  A red-eyed girl, on her knees in front of her boss.  You blush with shame.

&quot;Listen, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; he says, a surprising gentleness in his voice, &quot;I can see you&#39;re upset.  But we&#39;ll have to talk about it later.  Mr. Martinez is a really good client for us and he wants to discuss getting a few more girls for his strip club.  I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be eager to meet you...He has a thing for girls with long, &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; hair.&quot;

&quot;...oh God, no...&quot; you say, your eyes closing in resignation, &quot;...please, no...please!&quot;  You hear the words pouring out of your mouth, hoping that they&#39;ll finally sink into his head.  You&#39;re a guy!  You&#39;re not this little sexy, slut that you look like.  He HAS to understand.  He knows the truth...if only he&#39;ll...

&quot;Well, since you ARE upset, I guess I could tell him that you&#39;re off running errands for me.&quot;

&quot;Really???&quot; you ask, unable to hide the gratitude in your voice, &quot;You&#39;d do that?&quot;

&quot;I guess,&quot; he says, rubbing your cheek again with the back of his hand.  You let him, even though you know it makes you look more subservient.  As long as he doesn&#39;t make you parade around in front of this new guy, you&#39;ll put up with just about anything.

&quot;Quick.  Hide under the desk before he gets here,&quot; he says, rolling his chair away from the desk to allow you access.

You look up at him alarmed.  Hide under the desk?  His desk?  What if someone sees you under there?  What would they think?

&quot;Remember,&quot; Mr. Elliot whispers, &quot;Not a word...&quot; Then in a louder voice.  &quot;Come in, Mr. Martinez.&quot;

You watch Mr. Elliots legs disappear as he goes to greet the man.  You try to quietly rearrange yourself to get as comfortable as the cramped space allows.  The desk is built so that you fit perfectly underneath it...up to your shoulders.  Your head, on the other hand is pushed forward by a dropped down section.  You hope for the sake of comfort that this is not a long meeting.

&quot;So I hear you got yourself a new girl,&quot; says a man with a thick Italian accent, &quot;Can&#39;t wait to see her. Where is she?&quot;

You hold your breath, aware of every beat your heart makes. God, please don&#39;t let him know that you&#39;re here!

&quot;She was being whiny, so I&#39;m teaching her a lesson.&quot; Mr. Elliot says.  The men laugh even as you feel your lip go out in a pout.  You&#39;re grateful that Mr. Elliot is lying for you, but does he have to make you sound so bad?

&quot;Oh, I gotcha,&quot; the man says, a lewd sexual innuendo in his voice, &quot;Gotta teach &#39;em who&#39;s boss from the start.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Mr. Elliot says.  His legs reappear in front of you and he sits in his chair.  He looks down at you and winks. &quot;She&#39;s learning her place.&quot;

Then without warning, he rolls his chair up to the desk.

His legs squeeze in on either side of you and you find your head, pushed forward by the desk, pinned directly in his crotch!


[[Click here to continue.|m4_hidden1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="188" name="m4_meet" tags="" position="975,2350">There&#39;s no way you&#39;re getting underneath Mr. Elliot&#39;s desk.  You shake your head and look up at him with disgust.  He doesn&#39;t seem to notice.

&quot;Suit yourself,&quot; he says.  His thumbs roughly wipe off your tears and then he grabs you under your arms and lifts you to your feet.

&quot;Now this is an important client and since you&#39;re new here, I&#39;m going to explain the rules.  You do what you&#39;re told and curtsey when you&#39;re supposed to.  You are allowed to say the words: Yes.  Sir.  Please.  Thank-you.  And You&#39;re welcome.  Nothing else. Understood?  If you make even one mistake here, I swear to God, while they&#39;re giving you tits, they&#39;ll take away that thing between your legs too.  Do you understand me?&quot;  You nod your head, horrified.  He wouldn&#39;t!  He couldn&#39;t!

His eyes say differently. Yet how are you supposed to do anything with only those handful of words?

&quot;Mr. Martinez is a frequent client and when he comes in, he expects...certain things...Its your job to make sure he gets what he wants.  Understood?&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; you mumble submissively, bobbing a curtsey.  This has gone from bad to worse!  Would he really have them operate on you?

The knock on your door causes your heart to pound like a drum.  You look into Mr. Elliot&#39;s eyes and decide that without a doubt you need to be on your VERY best behaviour.

&quot;Go greet him,&quot; he growls before loudly calling, &quot;Come in, Mr. Martinez...&quot;

You scamper to the door, trembling all over.  You don&#39;t dare make a single mistake.  Not with what it could cost you!

&quot;Well, HELLO there darlin&#39;,&quot; Mr. Martinez says, his eyes soaking you up.  He&#39;s tall with dark skin.  Obviously Italian in descent.  His eyes have that wolfish quality that so many of the men around here seem to possess.  You start to say hello and then realize that that is not one of the allowed words.  Not knowing what else to do, you curtsey, blushing madly as you do so.

Mr. Martinez seems amused by your action and turns to greet Mr. Elliot.

&quot;John!  I heard you got a new girl, but I didn&#39;t know she was such a looker.  How new is she?&quot;

You stand awkwardly as the two men shake hands.  Should you get him a drink?  You don&#39;t know.  How would you know what to get him without asking and how could you ask with the words you have been allotted?  This is SO damn frustrating!

&quot;Its only her first day, can you believe it?&quot; Mr. Elliot says moving back around to his desk.  Mr. Martinez takes the seat that Mr. Pendlar had occupied only minutes ago.

&quot;No shit?&quot; Mr. Martinez says, &quot;You guys train &#39;em fast.&quot;  He snaps his fingers and the glare that Mr. Elliot gives you says that you&#39;re supposed to do something.

You scamper over beside Mr. Martinez and bob another curtsey.

&quot;Yes sir?&quot; you ask.  An absurd pride fills you that you get to actually use YOUR words.

&quot;Brandy.&quot; he barks at you.  For a minute you want to tell him your name&#39;s &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;, and then you realize that he wants a drink.  You quickly totter over to the bar, aware of his eyes on your backside as you walk. As you pour his drink, you bite your lower lip, mentally reviewing your performance so far.  So far so good.


[[Click here to continue.|m4_martinez]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="189" name="m4_hidden1" tags="" position="1100,2350">&quot;Please...grab yourself a drink,&quot; Mr. Elliot says as you try to pull your head out of his crotch.  You squirm, trying to get out of the awkward position, but his legs are squeezed tightly on either side of you.  You can&#39;t even get your arms up from your sides.  Doesn&#39;t he realize the horrid position he&#39;s put you in.  If he just scooted his chair back a little bit...

&quot;I just need to finish this email I was writing,&quot; you hear the tapping sounds as he pounds on the keyboard above you, &quot;The little bitch I&#39;m training today is a member of the tiny titty club, so I&#39;m trying to weasle her an appointment with Dr. Rakner.&quot;

Your already pounding heart beats faster.  He&#39;s still typing the email.  Oh God!  You squirm harder which only rewards you with a bone-crunching squeeze of Mr. Elliot&#39;s legs.

Mr. Martinez laughs from across the room and you hear him drop ice into his glass.

&quot;What size is she gettin&#39;? Big ones I hope.&quot;

&quot;&lt;&lt;print $breast_size&gt;&gt;&#39;s!  You should see this slut.  With her tiny little body they&#39;re gonna look spectacular.&quot;

You shiver as the mental image of what you would look like with breasts suddenly pops into your head.  They can&#39;t do this to you.  They just can&#39;t.

&quot;I can&#39;t wait to see her,&quot; the muffled voice of Mr. Martinez says, &quot;Think she&#39;d be any good as a dancer?&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Mr. Elliot says continuing to tap-tap-tap at the keys, &quot;But I&#39;ll tell you...She&#39;s gonna be EXPENSIVE.  She already has half a dozen bids on her and she&#39;s not even been here a whole day.&quot;

Mr. Martinez whistles at this even as you hear Mr. Elliot type the final line in.

&quot;All done,&quot; Mr. Elliot says.  His legs squeeze you as if to emphasize your eventual fate. &quot;By this time tomorrow, little &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt; is gonna be even more popular than she already is.&quot;  The men laugh even as you stifle a sob.  You close your eyes, praying with all your might that this is a bad dream.  You can&#39;t possibly be dressed as an office slut, trapped under your boss&#39; desk with your head in his lap while he signs you up for breast implants.  You&#39;ve only been in this horrid place for six hours!  How has this happened?

You bite your lip, trying not to cry.  The last thing you want is for this strip-club asshole to know that you&#39;re here!  You have to be quiet, despite the awkwardness of this situation.

&quot;So what can I help you with today?&quot; Mr. Elliot says.  His voice oozes charm.  You close your eyes, hoping this will be over soon.

&quot;Well, I got a list of what I&#39;m looking for...its pretty specific...You got time for this?&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; Mr. Elliot laughs, &quot;I&#39;ve got no plans for the rest of the day.  Let&#39;s wrestle this out and see if we can get you EXACTLY what you&#39;re looking for.&quot; The rest of the day???  You can&#39;t stay under here that long!

You squirm again, trying to get into a better position, something that doesn&#39;t involve your face in Mr. Elliot&#39;s crotch.  Nothing you do, seems to help.  You can swivel your head from side to side, but bent forward as it is, you can only hold the position for a few seconds before reverting to face forward.  You squirm again.  This is untolerable!  He has to scoot back!

Then you stop squirming.  The thing hidden in the pants only inches from your face...just woke up.


[[Click here to continue.|m4_hidden2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="190" name="m4_hidden2" tags="" position="1225,2350">Your squirming stops immediately.  How could you have been so stupid?  By wriggling about between his legs, you&#39;ve accidentally turned him on.  How is he going to concentrate on Mr. Martinez now?  He&#39;s going to be FURIOUS!

&quot;So I need a girl with &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; hair,&quot; you hear the sleazy Italian say, &quot;I had two of &#39;em but I gave &#39;em away as birthday presents...&quot;

You hear Mr. Elliot scribbling a note on the desk.  Then something brushes against your face and you almost scream!  You want to kick yourself when you realize that it&#39;s Mr. Elliots left hand.  The fingers of it twirl through you hair as his other hand takes notes upstairs.

&quot;...but she&#39;s gotta have a personality to fit the hair, you know what I&#39;m sayin&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Definately,&quot; Mr. Elliot says, his hand caressing your cheek.  You&#39;re both embarrassed and relieved.  At least he doesn&#39;t seem mad about you squirming around.  &quot;Long hair? Short?  Straight? Curly?&quot;

&quot;Long!&quot; Mr. Martinez says, &quot;Definately long...and I don&#39;t know...wavy?&quot;

&quot;Long, wavy &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; hair,&quot; Mr. Elliot says, squeezing you with his legs.  It takes you a second to realize why he squeezed you.  You have that kind of hair.

&quot;What else?&quot; The finger caressing your cheek slides down to the corner of your lips.  Your turn your head awkwardly trying to get the finger away from your mouth.  It follows staying at the corner of your lips.

&quot;...and long legs...I&#39;m talkin&#39; about the kind that go all the way up, you know what I&#39;m sayin&#39;?&quot;

Your neck begins to ache from the awkward angle and reluctantly you return your head to face forward.  As you turn, his finger slides between your lips, bumping against your closed teeth.  What is he DOING?&quot;

&quot;So the legs are more important than the tits?&quot; Mr. Elliot asks.  His finger begins to explore between your lips, sliding along your teeth to the side of your mouth, then back around to the other side.

&quot;Nah, tits are important too, but the legs...she&#39;s gotta have the legs...&quot;

His finger is pressing hard against your teeth now, his legs squeezing the breath out of you.  Why is he doing this?  Shouldn&#39;t he be focusing on Mr. Martinez?  Is this some sort of punishment for accidentally turning him on?&quot;;

You&#39;ve taken action against this beast and what is he going to do about it?  Punish you?  Not without giving away that he&#39;s not been focusing on Mr. Martinez.  Finally you have some leverage.

&quot;You all right?&quot; Mr Martinez asks.  Suddenly you don&#39;t feel so confident.  What if Mr. Elliot does tell him you&#39;re here.  What if he DOES punish you...in FRONT of Mr. Martinez...

&quot;I just have this HUGE pain in my NECK, today,&quot; Mr. Elliot says.  You breath a sigh of relief. &quot;Its just some kind of PINCHED nerve!&quot;

His hand goes around your face and squeezes, puckering your lips painfully into an &#39;O&#39;.

&quot;God, I hate that!&quot; Mr. Martinez says.  &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Mr. Elliot says, &quot;It&#39;ll get better or I&#39;ll have something DONE about it.&quot;  His legs squeeze you so tight that you think you&#39;re gonna pass out.

The bastard is stepping on it, pressing down hard and grinding it into the floor.  You let out an involuntary muffled squeak, as the pain becomes unbearable.

&quot;I need to oil this stupid chair,&quot; Mr. Elliot says, obviously in response to Mr. Martinez&#39;s puzzled look.  Unable to stop yourself, you let your teeth part and his meaty finger oozes into the deep recesses of your mouth.  Only then does the foot on your hand let up.

&quot;Oh, it don&#39;t really matter,&quot; Mr. Martinez says, &quot;They need to be nice, but so long as they&#39;re...well you know...perky, it don&#39;t matter...&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="193" name="m4_teeth_shut" tags="" position="350,2475">You keep your teeth clenched shut as he presses his finger hard against them.

Finally, you have some leverage.  You may be trapped under his desk, but HE&#39;s trapped too.

His finger stops pressing so hard against your teeth and you silently pat yourself on the back for your tenacity.

You hold your mouth as wide open as you can for a while, not wanting to wrap your lips around the finger sliding in and out of your mouth, but as Mr. Martinez rambles on and on about how important legs are to the dancers in his club, you reluctantly let your mouth relax around the intruder.

&quot;All right,&quot; Mr. Elliot says after what seems like an eternity, &quot;Now the fun part...what do you want her persona to be...&quot;

You close your eyes, trying to imagine that you&#39;re not in this horrible situation.  But the finger moving in your mouth keeps you focused on your predicament.  Its only when you open your eyes again that panic sets in.

&quot;You guys do such a good job with the eager little sluts...&quot; Mr. Martinez chuckles.  You barely hear him.  Mr. Elliots pants have grown.  They&#39;re only a half an inch from your eyes now, the beast within throbbing every other second.  You squirm in horror even as he continues to molest your mouth with his finger.

&quot;..but I&#39;ll tell ya&#39; John, I&#39;d love to get my hands on a girl who&#39;s still...I don&#39;t know...fresh...&quot;

&quot;Fresh?&quot; Mr. Elliot says.  His finger slides out of your mouth, dragging a trail of your spit to drizzle down your lip.

&quot;...you know...&quot; Mr. Martinez says, &quot;A girl who isn&#39;t fully trained yet...one that&#39;s a little more...innocent...naive...&quot;

The monster in Khaki grows bigger...closer...

&quot;How innocent are we talking here?&quot; Mr. Elliot asks.  The words are lost on you.  The thing in front of your face, throbs once, twice...and on the third time, barely touches you right between the eyes.  You turn your head, feeling it graze your cheek as you do.  You can&#39;t be here.  You&#39;ve got to get out of here.  This is TOO much!

&quot;Well...&quot; Mr. Martinez says, &quot;I&#39;d really like a girl who isn&#39;t USED to being a slut yet, does that make sense?&quot; 

&quot;Absolutely,&quot; Mr. Elliot says.  His legs squeeze around you again and you gasp softly in pain, &quot;So how much slut training do you want her to have had?&quot; Mr. Elliot asks.  Your neck aches from craning your face away, but you can&#39;t face forward...not with that thing there...You can feel it against the side of your head, seeming to grow even larger.

&quot;Some...&quot; Mr. Martinez says, &quot;At least a little bit...&quot;

&quot;Specifics, Mr. Martinez...we&#39;ll get you what you want, but you&#39;ll only get it if you let us know exactly what that is.  Why don&#39;t you get yourself another drink.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just tryin&#39; to figure out how to say it...&quot; he says.  You hear ice clinking in the glass and something else...something far worse...

Mr. Elliot is pulling his zipper down.

He does it slow, and you know that from where Mr. Martinez is, he can&#39;t hear it...but to you it sounds like a chainsaw.  Unable to help yourself your head swivles around to face front.  The thing still trapped inside his pants almost pokes you in the eye before resting against your forehead.  This can&#39;t be happening!  Why did you ever get under this desk?

&quot;For instance...&quot; Mr. Martinez is saying from the other side of the room, &quot;She should know how to give blow-jobs...but she should feel kinda dirty and ashamed while doing it.  Make any sense?&quot;

&quot;Perfect sense,&quot; Mr. Elliot says.  The zipper has finished its descent and the thing still loosely contained in his pants throbs faster in excitement. &quot;There&#39;s something sexy as hell about knowing the girl between your legs doesn&#39;t want to be there...&quot;  He squeezes you with his legs again.

&quot;Yeah, you know what I&#39;m talkin&#39; about,&quot; Mr. Martinez laughs, &quot;You got any olives?&quot;

&quot;Look in the back of the fridge,&quot; Mr. Elliot says.  Then without warning he shifts, his hand dipping into his pants and releasing the monster within...


[[Click here to continue.|m4_cock_tease]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="196" name="m4_cock_tease" tags="" position="725,2475">You wince as the horrid thing touches you.  Its bigger, now that it&#39;s been released from its restraints and the tip rests against the top of your forehead.  Turning your head does no good, no matter how you move, it touches you.  You can feel it throbbing against your skin, hot as a poker.

&quot;I need more details, Mr. Martinez,&quot; Mr. Elliot says, &quot;Try this.  Imagine you got this girl...this leggy, little, &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; haired girl down between your legs...&quot;

His legs squeeze you for emphasis.  You barely notice.  The only thing you can think about is the monster resting against your forehead.

&quot;She doesn&#39;t want to be there,&quot; Mr. Elliot continues, &quot;but she has to.  Let&#39;s say she&#39;s tied up, helpless on her knees in front of you.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Mr. Martinez says, his voice dreamy and distant, &quot;I&#39;m likin&#39; this story...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s her first day working for you...and you can tell by the way she&#39;s trembling that she&#39;s scared.&quot;

You watch in silent horror as his hand grabs hold of the monster.  This CAN&#39;T be happening!

He slides the beast down slowly, caressing the left side of your face. The tip grazes your earlobe.  It throbs with pleasure against your smooth skin as it journeys downward.

&quot;So she&#39;s scared...and helpless...as you present yourself to her...&quot;

The monster slides under your chin, and then begins ascending up the other side of your face.  It feels like its still growing although you don&#39;t see how that can be possible!You turn your head away from its caress, feeling it poke against your ear.

&quot;She turns her head away from you,&quot; Mr. Elliot says, &quot;But she&#39;s not stupid...at least...not THAT stupid...she knows that if she doesn&#39;t do what she&#39;s supposed to she will be punished.  Right?&quot;

&quot;Damn skippy,&quot; Mr. Martinez says, &quot;I&#39;d spank her ass till it fell off.&quot;

You feel the monster moving again, leaving a slimy trail across your cheek as it inches toward your mouth.  You turn your head as far as it&#39;ll go.  Your neck screams in pain, but you manage to keep your mouth out of reach.  The tip of his beast touches only the very corner of your lips.

&quot;So this girl...this &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; haired, cock-tease with her shiny &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; lips...what does she do?&quot;

Your neck aches and you know you can only keep it turned like this for a few more seconds.  Yet if you turn your head back, the thing pointed at your mouth will have no where to go except...in...What are you going to do?

You will not LET this happen.  You grit your teeth and keep your head turned just as far away from the throbbing monster as you can.  Somewhere in the distant recesses of your brain, you hear the Italian start to talk.

&quot;Well the kind of girl I&#39;d like wouldn&#39;t give in, right away.  She&#39;d resist, you know?&quot;  Your neck screams in agony.  Yet the thing throbbing against the corner of your mouth overpowers the pain.  Two seconds...three...Focus on something else...Anything else...Block out the pain and the dripping beast pressed against you.  Mr. Martinez is on a roll now, picking up speed.

&quot;But even while she&#39;s resisting, she&#39;s gettin&#39; a little turned on.  Her nipples would get all hard and her panties would just drip...&quot;

Your stomach turns as you realize that your panties ARE wet.  Surely that was from before though, right?  Before you got yourself into this dreadful position?

&quot;I&#39;d point it at her lips, but she wouldn&#39;t open them right away, you know what I mean? She&#39;d just let it sit there...pressed against her soft, wet lips.&quot;

Your neck screams in pain and you have no choice but to stop twisting so hard.  You turn no more than a half an inch, but its enough.  The tip of the horrid thing now touches your lips.  If anything, it feels hotter, more alive. A tear trickles down your cheek.  Why has this happened?

&quot;She&#39;d be too scared...too ashamed and shy to do anything else, so I&#39;d...I&#39;d press it between her lips...&quot;

You feel him forcing it in, even as your neck gives another half an inch.  The tip touches your clenched teeth, which you grind together so hard that you feel like they&#39;re going to break.  You will NOT let that thing in your mouth!

&quot;Would she open her mouth then?&quot; Mr. Elliot asks, &quot;Or would she keep it shut?&quot;

Your neck gives way more and the monster slips along your teeth, behind the other side of your lip.  You shiver as you feel it inside your cheek.  The thing is INSIDE your mouth and yet STILL you keep your teeth shut.

His legs squeeze you hard and your neck finally gives way...only...You can&#39;t turn your face forward anymore.  The thing sliding along your teeth hits your cheek and keeps your head from turning any further.  Worse yet it seems to still be growing.  Your neck aches from its exertion and yet now...now the only way to relieve the pain is to open your mouth and let the monster in.

&quot;Nah!&quot; Mr. Martinez laughs, &quot;She&#39;d be stubborn...so you know what I&#39;d do?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Mr. Elliot asks.  His hand, no longer needed for manuevering is caressing your cheek again.

&quot;I&#39;d hold her nose until she opened her mouth.&quot;

Oh God!  His thumb and finger clamp over your nose and you panic.  You can&#39;t breath.  Not enough.  Not with your mouth shut and his...thing...blocking most of the air...You start to grow light-headed and still you resist.  Your teeth hurt, your neck hurts and to add insult to injury, your panties grow damper.  The room begins to spin and for a minute you think you&#39;re going to die.  Then your body betrays you and your mouth gasps for air.  Only a little comes in.  Something else takes up most of the room.

You breathe as deeply as you can when he releases your nose and with the air comes the realization of what has happened.  The horrible, throbbing beast has won.  He doesn&#39;t move it...and you can&#39;t move, so it just sits there...throbbing deep in your mouth.  You swallow involuntarily, feeling your tongue massage the underside of it.  Nausea builds and suddenly all of your energy is devoted toward not vomiting.

&quot;So what does this little tease of yours feel as she finally submits to you?&quot; Mr. Elliot asks.  Both of his hands are back up on his desk now.  He doesn&#39;t need them.  The thing is too far into your mouth for you to get it back out.  You try turning your head, helplessly.  You can&#39;t get the tip past your teeth.  You&#39;re trapped, pinned to the desk by this thing in your mouth...

&quot;Well she&#39;d feel ashamed...This is a girl who never thought she&#39;d end up as a cock-sucking slut, you know?  But she&#39;d also feel...I don&#39;t know...excited by it.  She&#39;d feel horribly dirty and yet turned on...and being turned on would make it even more humiliating...do you get what I&#39;m saying?&quot;

&quot;Oh I think I get the drift,&quot; Mr. Elliot chuckles.  Another tear trickles down your cheek as the thing in your mouth throbs.  You know how this is going to end...even without either of you moving...you know what will eventually happen...

&quot;Well I think I can find just the right girl for you,&quot; he says to Mr. Martinez, &quot;So let&#39;s discuss what she&#39;s going to cost...&quot;


[[Click here to continue.|m4_swallowed]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="198" name="m4_let_him" tags="" position="975,2475">&quot;Well the girl I want would not be one of those eager to please sluts,&quot; Mr. Martinez says, &quot;She&#39;d know what was expected, but she&#39;d be too humiliated to do much more than just take it.&quot;

Tears stream down your cheeks and it takes every bit of effort you have not to sob out loud.  The pulsing thing at the corner of your mouth throbs as if taking pleasure from your misery.  You know what you have to do.  But doing it...

&quot;So she&#39;d just open her mouth and let me use her...&quot; the Italian says as the beast slides between your shiny &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; lips.  It grows even bigger as it slides in, past your teeth and across your tongue.  You can taste the slimy liquid that is oozing out its tip and the meaty taste of him fills your mouth.  You close your lips around the thing, waiting for him to slide in and out.  He doesn&#39;t move it...and you can&#39;t move, so it just sits there...throbbing deep in your mouth.  You swallow involuntarily, feeling your tongue massage the underside of it.  Nausea builds and suddenly all of your energy is devoted toward not vomiting.

[[Click here to continue.|m4_swallowed]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="199" name="m4_do_it" tags="" position="1100,2475">&quot;Well,&quot; Mr. Martinez says, &quot;The girl would know that she had no choice in things, right?&quot; The thing at the corner of your mouth throbs as Mr. Elliot squeezes his legs around you again. &quot;So even though she&#39;d feel dirty and ashamed and humiliated as hell...&quot;

You know how this is going to end.  You can&#39;t hold your head at this angle for more than a few seconds and once you turn it back...

&quot;...she&#39;d do what needs to be done...&quot;

Trembling you let the tension on your neck release.  The pulsing beast slides between your painted &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; lips as if it belongs there.  You open your mouth and let it continue its journey...past your teeth and across your tongue.  It grows even bigger and you can taste the slimy liquid that is oozing out its tip.  The meaty taste of him fills your mouth.  You close your lips around the thing, waiting for him to slide in and out.

He doesn&#39;t move it...and you can&#39;t move, so it just sits there...throbbing deep in your mouth.  You swallow involuntarily, feeling your tongue massage the underside of it.  Nausea builds and suddenly all of your energy is devoted toward not vomiting.

...until it&#39;s done...

&quot;Well she&#39;d feel ashamed...This is a girl who never thought she&#39;d end up as a cock-sucking slut, you know?  But she&#39;d also feel...I don&#39;t know...excited by it.  She&#39;d feel horribly dirty and yet turned on...and being turned on would make it even more humiliating...do you get what I&#39;m saying?&quot;

&quot;Oh I think I get the drift,&quot; Mr. Elliot chuckles.  Another tear trickles down your cheek as the thing in your mouth throbs.  You can feel the tension in Mr. Elliot now...sexual tension.  He wants to move.  Slide the thing in and out of your mouth.  But he can&#39;t.  Not with Mr. Martinez there.  You know how this is going to end...even without either of you moving...you know what will eventually happen...so better to get it done...get it over with...

&quot;I&#39;d want her to know how to please me, though...you know?  She&#39;d need to know what feels good and what to do...

You can&#39;t move your head back...but you can do what this horrible man wants.  Crying full out now, you push your head forward, feeling the meaty thing invade the back of your mouth.  You can&#39;t go far without gagging, but you know that it doesn&#39;t take much movement...it just takes the right kind.  You&#39;re more familiar with this equipment than ANY girl.

You tickle the underside of it with your tongue as you move and you can feel him stiffen as you hit a sensitive spot.

&quot;Then as she&#39;s going down on me,&quot; Mr. Martinez continues, &quot;She&#39;d sort of...I don&#39;t know...get into it...&quot;

You press your lips tightly against the thing as you move.  You don&#39;t dare suck on it, not without fear of making too much noise...in fact...

You slow down, painfully afraid that you&#39;d made too many slurping sounds...The thing in your mouth oozes at your change in tempo and you swallow, which only stimulates it more...You know he&#39;s getting close...

&quot;So you want the girl to secretly enjoy being slutty, while still being humiliated by it?&quot; Mr. Elliot asks.  You&#39;re amazed that he can keep his voice that steady.  If you were in his shoes, you&#39;d be screaming...The thought of being in Mr. Elliot&#39;s position causes the thing between your legs to swell and ache against the belt.  It spurts helplessly as you continue to lick and swallow the much bigger thing in your mouth.

He is positively oozing now and you brace yourself for what you know is about to happen, even as you add your own unsatisfying contribution to your damp, &lt;&lt;print $panty_color&gt;&gt; panties.

&quot;Well I think I can find just the right girl for you,&quot; he says to Mr. Martinez, as you receive what you worked so hard for. &quot;So let&#39;s discuss what this girl is going to cost...&quot;


[[Click here to continue.|m4_swallowed]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="200" name="m4_swallowed" tags="" position="1225,2475">&quot;So just check your email tomorrow,&quot; Mr. Elliot says, &quot;I&#39;ll send pictures and bios of three potential girls and we&#39;ll go from there.&quot; You watch him easily tuck the deflated beast into his pants and slowly ease his zipper back up.&quot;I am sorry you didn&#39;t get to meet the new girl I&#39;m working on.  The lazy slut is probably tucked away somewhere hiding.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I was hopin&#39; to see her,&quot; Mr. Martinez says, &quot;I hear she&#39;s a real looker.&quot;

&quot;Well she IS that,&quot; Mr. Elliot says.  He rolls his chair away from the desk and stands up, &quot;But never fear...you won&#39;t leave unsatisfied...&quot;

The intercom over your head buzzes and you hear Nikki&#39;s voice again. 

&quot;Yes sir, Mr. Elliot,&quot;

&quot;Get Krissy to cover the phone for you and show Mr. Martinez the new photography studio, ok?&quot;

&quot;Yes sir, Mr. Elliot,&quot; The intercom buzzes out. &quot;Nikki&#39;s great.  There&#39;s a reason we leave her in the lobby.  You&#39;ll have lots of fun.  And the studio she&#39;ll take you to will provide you with a memento to take home with you.&quot;

Mr. Martinez chuckles and you watch Mr. Elliot lean over the desk, presumably to shake hands with the other man.

&quot;Here, I&#39;ll walk you out,&quot; Mr. Elliot says and his legs disappear out of your vision.  You hear the door open and shut as the two men continue talking and then silence.

You squeeze out from under the desk.  Your body aches and you realize that you have absolutely no idea how long you were under there.  Time ceased to be after a point.

You tremble at the idea of seeing Mr. Elliot.  How can you face him now?  How could he have done that to you, knowing that you&#39;re really a guy?

You hear the outer door open and you realize you&#39;re trembling again.  You don&#39;t dare look up for fear of having to look into his face.

You see his feet enter the room and a fresh batch of tears begin to brew in your eyes.  You swallow hard, painfully aware of the residual taste in your mouth and throat.  You wonder if you will ever be able to NOT taste it...HIM...ever again.


[[Click here to continue.|m4_epilogue]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="201" name="m4_martinez" tags="" position="100,2600">&quot;Give me just one more minute,&quot; Mr. Elliot says sitting at his desk and putting his hands on the keyboard, &quot;I just need to finish this email I was working on.&quot;

You almost spill the brandy all over Mr. Martinez as you gaze at Mr. Elliot in horror.  He&#39;s still working on the email!

&quot;Oh take your time,&quot; Mr. Martinez says, grabbing the brandy out of your shaking hand, &quot;I&#39;ve got a drink, and a good cigar...and &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt; here, to keep me occupied.  You smile at him nervously, but your brain is focused on the tap tap tapping of the keys at the desk.

&quot;Thank you.  It&#39;ll just take a minute,&quot; Mr. Elliot says, &quot;&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt; has begged me ALL afternoon to get her an appointment with Dr. Rakner.&quot;

What!?!  Begged!?!

&quot;Heh,&quot; Mr. Martinez chuckles, pulling a cigar tube out of his breast pocket. &quot;Rakner&#39;s a artist.  That&#39;s for sure.  What size are you going to get her?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s got her little heart set on a &lt;&lt;print $breast_size&gt;&gt;-cup,&quot; Mr. Elliot says.  His fingers continue to fly across the keys and you shiver.  Then you realize that Mr. Martinez is looking at you and you smile as best you can.

&quot;Is that true darlin&#39;?&quot; Mr. Martinez says, a hand snaking around to pat your behind.  You flinch as he touches you, unable to help yourself.  You start to tell him &#39;No&#39;.  That you don&#39;t want breasts, especially &lt;&lt;print $breast_size&gt;&gt;-cups.  But before the words leave your lips, you realize that &#39;no&#39; is not one of the words you&#39;re allowed.  Mr. Elliot has stopped typing and is looking at you with squinty eyes.  He&#39;s waiting for you to answer.  Would he really tell this Dr. Raknar to cut off your penis?  Surely not...

But the look in his eyes says otherwise.  What feels like an eternity ticks by and you know you need to respond...but how???


[[Yes sir.|m4_yes_to_breasts][$score_sub += 1]]
[[Shake your head no.|m4_shake_head][$score_dom += 1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="202" name="m4_yes_to_breasts" tags="" position="225,2600">&quot;...yes, sir...&quot; You say, ashamed of the words escaping your lips.  Out of the corner of your eye you see Mr. Elliot smile as he continues to inform the Doctor how big your breasts should be.

&quot;Well those&#39;ll look nice on you darlin&#39;&quot;

Mr. Martinez says.  The hand that patted your ass, has taken up residence.  You feel like crying again. 

&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; you say, dipping into your seven word vocabulary.

&quot;...and with those long legs of yours, you&#39;re gonna be smokin&#39;.&quot; he says.  The hand on your ass pushes slightly, guiding you in front of him.  You totter on the heels, letting yourself be escorted.

&quot;C&#39;mere,&quot; he says.  It&#39;s obviously not a request.  He yanks you down across his lap and you automatically assume the expected position, wrapping an arm around his neck.  Your skirt doesn&#39;t even pretend to cover anything this time.  Its pooled around your waist, revealing everything.  You blush a crimson color as you stare down at the &lt;&lt;print $panty_color&gt;&gt; panties, perfectly framed by the taut garter straps on either side.

You can&#39;t help but feel a surge of relief that the hand across your legs is holding the cigar tube.  At least he can&#39;t feel you up like all the other guys have done.


[[Click here to continue.|m4_martinez2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="203" name="m4_shake_head" tags="" position="350,2600">Well just because you can&#39;t say NO doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t make your feelings known.  You shake your head and look at Mr. Martinez with a sad pouty look.  Of course you don&#39;t want breasts!

&quot;Well she really wanted some sort of F-cup balloon things,&quot; Mr. Elliot laughs, &quot;But I told her she&#39;s going to have to trust me.  Besides, she&#39;d hurt herself with tits that big.&quot;  You glare at Mr. Elliot.  How can he blatantly lie like that?

You see the broad smile on his face and think for a moment about yelling at him.  Then you see the way his eyes are burning into you.  You may have just made a mistake.  Underneath his good humour, Mr. Elliot is REALLY mad at you. 

&quot;Well those&#39;ll look nice on you darlin&#39;&quot;

Mr. Martinez says.  The hand that patted your ass, has taken up residence.  You feel like crying again. 

&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; you say, dipping into your seven word vocabulary.

[[Click here to continue.|m4_martinez2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="204" name="m4_martinez2" tags="" position="475,2600">&quot;All done,&quot; Mr. Elliot says, clicking the mouse and sending the horrid email zooming into cyberspace.

&quot;Aw,&quot; Mr. Martinez says, &quot;And me and &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt; were just startin&#39; to get acquainted...&quot; he taps the tip of your nose with the cigar tube, playfully.  You smile inanely at him, not sure what else to do.  You&#39;re not allowed to talk or to get off of his lap.  You&#39;re just a plaything for him...for both of these men.  You feel utterly helpless and out of control...and worse, you can imagine how Mr. Martinez feels.  You think about sitting with a sexy girl draped across your lap.  The power must be intoxicating.

You can&#39;t help but stare at the tube cross-eyed as he lowers it to your lips.  It continues to descend between the swell of your breasts and down your stomach until coming to a rest in your lap.

&quot;So what can I do for you this afternoon?&quot; Mr. Elliot asks.  He leans back in his chair, arms crossed, smirking at you.  You almost think he enjoys seeing you stretched across this man.  You glare at him, letting him know just exactly how you feel about this situation.

Your glare loses some of its impact when the horrified squeak leaves your lips.

Mr. Martinez has moved the cigar tube between your thighs.  It traces the line where your legs tuck into the lacey panties.

You squirm uncomfortably as it worms its way inside the material, easing its way down the curve of your chastity belt.  You look at Mr. Elliot, waiting for him to say something...to put this horrid man in his place.

But the smirk is still there...unchanged.

&quot;Well I need a new girl,&quot; Mr. Martinez says, looking from your worried face to Mr. Elliot and then back to you, &quot;A fresh face for the club...&quot;

The tube has wormed its way down to the lowest part of your crotch.  You put your hands around the arm holding the tube, trying to pull the intruder out from between your legs, but the burly Italian easily out powers your effort.  He just chuckles and begins to slide the tip of the tube left and right against the underside of your crotch.  You squirm at the sensation.  He&#39;s tickling the tiny hole in the belt with the tube, and with each pass it makes your tucked away member throbs in its restraint.

&quot;How&#39;d the last girl we got you turn out?&quot; Mr. Elliot asks still unconcerned with your plight, &quot;Roxy was it?&quot;

&quot;Aw yeah...she was great...&#39;cept we renamed her Foxy...&quot;  the tube brushes against your pleasure spot again and you squeal, squirming around like a fish as your panties grow ever damper. &quot;Yeah, she was a hot, little thing...but one of my boys had the hots for her so I gave her to him as a birthday present...&quot;

A birthday present!  That&#39;s horrible!  It&#39;s like the women here aren&#39;t even human, they&#39;re just...

Another squirt as the tube presses your pleasure spot and rests there.  The man is driving you crazy!  You&#39;ve got to get out this belt!  You can&#39;t think straight anymore...All you can focus on is the infuriating need between your legs!

&quot;So what are you looking for this time?&quot; Mr. Elliot asks.  You barely hear him.  The tube is no longer moving left and right. Instead he&#39;s running it forward and backward, sliding it slowly along the oh-so-sensitive spot!

You whimper, your legs unclamping from around his hand and easing open a little.  The extra freedom only encourages Mr. Martinez to slide the tube further.  It eases between the bottom of your asscheeks and stops.  You whimper again, with need and desperation.  You&#39;re so close!  How can you be THIS close to orgasm just from being rubbed with a little tube.  You feel his fingers, barely holding the end of the tube pressed up against your crotch and despite the horror of the situation, your legs ease open further.  Just a little more...that&#39;s all you need...just a little more...

Mr. Martinez says something to Mr. Elliot, but you have no idea what.  All of your attention is focused on the tube that your crotch now stradles.  The tube that has begun to twist and turn.

Unable to help yourself you begin to grind against the tube, trying with all your might to stimulate that tiny, little spot.

Mr. Elliot says something else, but again its distant and far off.  You&#39;re so close...You&#39;re so close...You&#39;re...


[[Click here to continue.|m4_display]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="205" name="m4_display" tags="" position="600,2600">&quot;Well?&quot; Mr. Martinez asks, looking at you.

You stare at him as if the word has no meaning.  He&#39;s stopped moving the tube...He&#39;s stopped and you still haven&#39;t...

&quot;&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;!&quot; Mr. Elliot barks, &quot;We already know you&#39;re a slut, you don&#39;t need to prove it.  Now get up!&quot;

What!?! Get up? Now?  But you&#39;re so...

Mr. Martinez&#39;s lap suddenly disappears and you find yourself tottering around on shaky legs.  There&#39;s another ineffectual squirt between your legs as the lacy underwear tickles you.  This is unbearable.  Your whole body burns...throbs...

&quot;Obviously the little slut wasn&#39;t listening to us,&quot; Mr. Elliot says getting up and coming over to you.  His hand smacks your ass hard enough to make you squeal and you cover your behind with your hands in the hope that it&#39;ll prevent a repeat.

&quot;Now stand up straight and let Mr. Martinez show me what he&#39;s looking for,&quot; Mr. Elliot growls.

What is he talking about?  What did you miss?

You curtsey, adding a mumbled &#39;yes sir&#39; and then assume the expected position.  You don&#39;t like the way this is going.  What is Mr. Martinez going to show Mr. Elliot?  You shiver as some unnerving thoughts creep into your head.  Yet despite your your uncomfortable stance, your humiliating outfit, and your degrading role in this little business meeting...You squirt again into the fabric between your legs.


[[Click here to continue|m4_good_stuff]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="206" name="m4_good_stuff" tags="" position="725,2600">&quot;Let&#39;s start with what you like,&quot; Mr. Elliot says, sitting on the edge of his desk.

&quot;Well she&#39;s got the legs, that&#39;s for sure...&quot; Mr. Martinez says. He circles you and you feel his eyes absorbing every inch of your body.  You slam your eyes shut...this is SOOO humiliating...

&quot;Show me your ass,&quot; Mr. Martinez barks.  Reluctantly, you turn around.

&quot;Lift your skirt, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; Mr. Elliot says in a tone that implies you&#39;re as stupid as a three year old.  You blush a deep red as you raise the slinky skirt up over the swell of you behind and hold it there.

&quot;Well, it ain&#39;t bad,&quot; Mr. Martinez says, &quot;Most of our girls get a little extra added back there, so it could be a LITTLE bigger...&quot;

You cringe as his hands cup your poor, abused behind.  He squeezes it roughly, as if he&#39;s picking out a piece of fruit.

&quot;She&#39;s nice and firm already.  A few days of dancing and you could bounce quarters off her...&quot;

&quot;So her size or bigger,&quot; Mr. Elliot repeats, jotting down notes on a legal pad, &quot;But firm...&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Mr. Martinez says, his hands still holding your cheeks, &quot;The ass is the most important part of our girls.  Think about it...When  you picture a lap dance, what image goes through your head?&quot;

A lap dance?  Oh dear lord...

&quot;Bounce up and down for me, girl,&quot; The man behind you says, releasing your behind from his meaty palms.

Bounce?  He&#39;s got to be kidding.

The silence behind you says otherwise.  With every last ounce of your dignity thrown out the window you hop in place.  You can feel their eyes eating up every last jiggle.

&quot;See.  She&#39;s not quite big enough.  It needs to  be a little rounder...&quot;

&quot;But some implants back there are ok, right?  I mean, they jiggle just as good as the real thing...&quot;

&quot;Sometimes better,&quot; Mr. Martinez laughs, &quot;Yeah...some butt work is fine...&quot;

Tears begin to well up in your eyes...Not only are they transforming you into this horrible, sexy creature...but they&#39;re going to sell you!  How are you going to get out of here!?!


[[Click here to continue.|m4_bad_stuff]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="207" name="m4_bad_stuff" tags="" position="850,2600">&quot;All right, what else?&quot; Mr. Elliot says.  You want more than anything to release your skirt and cover up your exposed behind.  But until they tell you too, you don&#39;t dare!

&quot;Turn around,&quot; Mr. Martinez says and you gratefully turn, using the opportunity to lower your skirt.

&quot;She&#39;s got a great mouth,&quot; Mr. Martinez says, tracing your lips with his thumb.  You hold perfectly still afraid to do anything.

&quot;Eyes ain&#39;t bad either...But her nose is too big!&quot;

Mr. Elliot chuckles as he writes.  You blush.  You have a feeling, you know why he&#39;s laughing.

&quot;Stick out your tongue!&quot;

What?  Oh god...

You poke your tongue out between your painted, &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; lips.  You feel like an animal being sold at auction.

&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s what I thought...the girl I want needs to be pierced...&quot;

&quot;Tongue piercing...&quot; Mr. Elliot transcribes.

&quot;And navel...two in each ear..and one between her legs...&quot;

Your eyes go wide!  Piercings?

&quot;...and of course her tits...&quot; he says, grabbing one side of your chest and playfully squeezing it, &quot;...The &lt;&lt;print $breast_size&gt;&gt;&#39;s she&#39;s gonna get would be fine...bigger would be better...&quot;

Dear lord...you just want to curl into a ball and die...this can&#39;t be happening...

&quot;But most important, I want a girl who will do what she&#39;s told, when she&#39;s told...&quot; 

&quot;Of course,&quot; Mr. Elliot says, &quot;That&#39;s always part of the package.&quot;

&quot;But I don&#39;t want one of your girls that&#39;s so trained she&#39;s USED to being a slut...&quot; Mr. Martinez laughs, &quot;You almost train em too good here.  I want one that doesn&#39;t want to be my helpless, little bitch, but has to anyway!&quot;

&quot;Aha!&quot; Mr. Elliot says, putting his pad down and walking over to you, &quot;Now I see what you&#39;re after.  You want one of our girls who doesn&#39;t yet THINK of herself as a slut...even though she is one!&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Mr. Martinez says, &quot;That&#39;s exactly what I want.  I want to look into her eyes as she kneels between my legs and see her shame...her humiliation...Look at HER face.&quot;

He points at you.

&quot;She has that look!&quot; he says.  His hand encircles your arm and before you know what&#39;s happening he&#39;s pulling you over toward the chair.  He plops down in it and yanks your arm hard enough to cause you to yelp.  You collapse to your knees in front of him, staring up at him in pain and horror!

He places your hand on his crotch, still holding your wrist in his vice-like grip.

&quot;Do you see the look she has on her face?&quot; he asks, his other hand grabbing your chin and turning your head toward Mr. Elliot.  You stare at him in anguish...begging him with your eyes to please help you.

The smirk appears on Mr. Elliot&#39;s face as if by magic.

&quot;I&#39;ve got half a dozen girls that fit your criteria perfectly,&quot; Mr. Elliot says, &quot;...give me ten minutes and I&#39;ll print out some info on them for you. &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;!  Keep Mr. Martinez entertained.  I&#39;ll be right back!&quot;

The sound of the door slamming behind Mr. Elliot pounds into your ears, even as your eyes travel back up to meet Mr. Martinez.

&quot;Well?&quot; he asks, his eyes eating up every inch of your being, &quot;What are you waiting for?  Entertain me.  My pants ain&#39;t gonna undo themselves!&quot;

Never in a million years would you have thought you would be in this position.  The hand around your wrist squeezes and you whimper in pain.  This brute isn&#39;t kidding!  He honestly wants you to...

Another hard squeeze on your wrist and the &lt;&lt;print$nal_color&gt;&gt; nailed hands in front of you begin to fumble at his pants. You look up into his eyes again, hoping against hope that there is some mercy in them...some hope...

The wolfish smirk on his face fills you with dread.  Not only is there no mercy in his eyes...there is something far worse...

The beast within his trousers throbs as you slide the zipper down and you start to tremble with fear.  This is too much.  You can&#39;t do this!

The hand on your wrist finally lets go...but not before Mr. Martinez wraps his legs around your middle, crossing them at the ankles.  You&#39;re held tight to his body now, able to move up and down but not away!  You see another twitch inside the plaid boxers that now peek out.

&quot;If I didn&#39;t know better,&quot; Mr. Martinez says, grabbing your chin and forcing you to look up at him again, &quot;I&#39;d think this was your first time doing this, girl.&quot;

You swallow hard, unable to come to grips with the situation you have found yourself in.  &quot;Well, don&#39;t worry.  I&#39;ll teach you everything you need to know.&quot;

The hand on your chin, slowly moves upward and strokes your cheek.  You flinch away from it, unable to help yourself. There&#39;s no escape!  You&#39;re at this man&#39;s every whim and you can either do it willingly, or have it done to you!

&quot;First thing you gotta do is reach inside,&quot; Mr. Martinez says, &quot;Reach inside and pull it out, girl.  Better hurry up too, before it gets too big.  Every second I look at that pretty face or yours is only making things more difficult for you.&quot;

You try to get up...to get away from the horrible man, but the hand on your wrist yanks you back down between his legs no matter how much you struggle.

Well he can keep you here, but he can&#39;t make you do anything...especially THAT!

&quot;You are EXACTLY what I&#39;m looking for girl,&quot; he laughs, his hand going running through your hair, &quot;A little fire.  A little resistence.&quot;

The hand in your hair, pulls your head closer to his lap.  You struggle against it, but the brute easily overpowers you.  Your cheek rests on his thigh, your eye pointed firmly at his lap.

&quot;I don&#39;t even care about that other stuff.  With that hot, little mouth of yours and those big puppy-dog eyes...&quot;

The hand not holding your head is unfastening the belt.  Oh God...  You squirm and struggle but can&#39;t even get your head off his leg.  The button on his pants is opened.  You struggle harder, actually lifting up a few inches before being slammed back down.

&quot;Oh yeah...go on and fight it,&quot; Mr. Martinez chuckles, &quot;But you know what you REALLY want...&quot;

The zipper sounds like a chainsaw in your ears, each tooth pounding in your head like a drum.  His legs wrap around your middle, crossing at the ankles, even as the hand on your head finally lets go.  You spring upward, trying to get away, but his legs keep you pinned firmly to him.  You&#39;re held tight to his body, able to move up and down but not away!  You see another twitch inside the plaid boxers that now peek out.

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; he asks his hand stroking your long, &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; hair.

&quot;They&#39;re holding me prisoner...&quot; you say as his hand plunges into your hair, &quot;They&#39;ve forced me to look like this...to BE like this...&quot;

&quot;Be like what?&quot; he asks.  The hand in your hair slowly curls around the back of your head.

&quot;This...slutty...little...office girl that they&#39;ve turned me into,&quot; you say.  Is he even listening?

&quot;You DON&#39;T want to look like this?&quot; he asks, &quot;Why are you dressed like that, then?&quot;

The hand on your head is pushing you forward slightly.  You resist, but the brute is much stronger than you.  Your whole body is trembling.  You&#39;ve got to make him see.  You&#39;ve just got to!

&quot;They dressed me up like this!&quot; you cry, &quot;They put me in this stupid chastity belt and have been trying to turn me into...into...&quot; You want to say &#39;a girl&#39;, but then he might know that you&#39;re really a guy!  You whimper as his hand forces your cheek against his thigh.  You try to push away, but he easily keeps you pinned.  This can&#39;t be happening!  Doesn&#39;t he understand?

&quot;You know,&quot; he says chuckling, &quot;I think you may be EXACTLY the kind of girl I&#39;m looking for!&quot;

You look up at him with tears in your eyes.

&quot;Please...no...You&#39;ve got to help me!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t even care about that other stuff.  With that hot, little mouth of yours and those big puppy-dog eyes...&quot;

The zipper sounds like a chainsaw in your ears, each tooth pounding in your head like a drum.

&quot;...please...no...&quot;

His legs wrap around your middle, crossing at the ankles, even as the hand on your head finally lets go.  You spring upward, trying to get away, but his legs keep you pinned firmly to him.

How can this be happening?  How have you ended up made up to look like an office wet-dream on your knees with your hands in a man&#39;s pants?  You feel the throb as you come into contact with the monster within.  Its still held prisoner within the plaid boxer shorts, but you can&#39;t help but whimper as it responds to your touch.

&quot;Come on, girl,&quot; Mr. Martinez says, squeezing you with his legs, &quot;There&#39;s a hole in the middle...slide your fingers inside...&quot; 

The long, &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; nails disappear and then you all you are aware of is the hot, throbbing thing at your fingertips.

&quot;There you go, honey,&quot; he says stroking your head like an obedient dog, &quot;That&#39;s the thing you want...Just pull it out...&quot;

Oh God!

You try to manuever the monster out of the cage, touching it as little as possible.  It isn&#39;t an easy task.  Everytime you think you&#39;ve got it going the right direction, it throbs and becomes more difficult to manuveur.

&quot;Hurry it up, girl.  Don&#39;t be afraid to touch it.&quot; He squeezes you hard with his legs and you abandon your caution.  You wrap your fingers around it and wrestle the thing out into the open.  You release it instantly, unable to stop feeling the heat of it in your hands.

&quot;What do you think, girl?&quot; he asks, stroking your head again, &quot;Don&#39;t worry.  It gets a little bigger...especially for a sexy, little thing like you.&quot;

Bigger?  Oh God!  It&#39;s already HUGE!

&quot;See?&quot; he says as the thing throbs a little bigger, &quot;It likes you!  Why don&#39;t you give it a kiss hello.&quot;

You whimper.  His legs squeeze you tightly and you know you have no other options...

Trembling,  you lean forward, puckering your lips lightly against the tip of the beast.  You pull away as quick as you can, as if to deny that it ever happened...even though you can still feel the heat of it on your trembling lips.

&quot;Good girl,&quot; he says, patting your head again, &quot;Now kiss it again.  Longer this time!&quot;

You close your eyes as you lean forward with your puckered, &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; lips again.  You feel it throb against you, sliding between them slightly.  You can&#39;t help but imagine a girl who looks like you between your own legs.  There&#39;s a throb in your chastity belt at the thought, even as Mr. Martinez urges his member further into your mouth.

You let it slide in.  There&#39;s no point in resisting.  He&#39;s going to get what he wants.  The only thing you can do now is to get it over with.

&quot;Open your eyes, bitch,&quot; he growls above you, &quot;Look up at me as you taste it for the first time.&quot;

You slowly open your eyes, letting your gaze rest on his as he creeps into the back of your mouth.  The look in his eyes is a deep and all-consuming satisfaction.  Until you have accomplished your task, you belong to him and you both know it.

&quot;Now admit it, you little slut...you like this, don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;God you are just too perfect,&quot; he says stroking your cheek with his hand.  You struggle again to get away, but his legs crush the breath out of you, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, baby, you&#39;ll learn to love doing this.&quot;  You struggle harder as you see his hand dip into his pants.  No.  This won&#39;t happen.  This can&#39;t happen!

Then the bloated, throbbing beast breaks out into the open and you whimper in fear.

&quot;...please...don&#39;t do this...&quot; you whimper as the hand on your cheek slides behind your head.

&quot;Shhhh!&quot; he says softly, &quot;Don&#39;t worry girl.  It won&#39;t hurt you.  See?  It likes you.&quot;

The thing throbs as he pulls your head down only inches away from it.  You stare it cross-eyed, trying with all your might to push yourself away.  He laughs as you escape from his hand, wriggling with all your might against his legs.  He squeezes you hard and you gasp for breath, even as he puts both hands around your head and pulls it forward.  You whimper again as it touches your lips.

&quot;There you go,&quot; he whispers, &quot;Give it a nice, big kiss.&quot;

You struggle away and he pulls harder, sliding the intruder between your clenched lips.  You squirm with horror and fear as he slides it along your clenched teeth, exploring the outer rim of your mouth.

&quot;You look good like this, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; he says, sliding himself into your cheek.  You look up at him, your eyes begging.  He just grins at you like a wolf.

&quot;Ready to taste it?&quot; he asks.  You shake your head as much as his hands will allow.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, girl...you&#39;ll like it.  Come on...open up!&quot;

His thumbs begin to press against you jaw and it takes all your effot to keep it clenched shut.  The thing in your cheek throbs, drooling out a slimy liquid against your gums.  You shiver in revulsion.

His thumb presses against the nerve in your jaw and it pops open against your will.  The slimy beast pushes past your teeth and into the dark, recesses of your mouth.  The thing slides across your tongue, stopping just shy of your gag reflex.

Neither of you move for a second.  You out of fear and revulsion, him out of pleasure and satisfaction.

&quot;And don&#39;t even think about biting me, bitch,&quot; he growls, sliding himself out slightly and then back in, &quot;Or I&#39;ll make sure you don&#39;t have teeth to bite with.&quot;  You look up at him in horror, even as he continues to ease in and out of your mouth.  The slimy thing throbs against your tongue and for a minute you think you&#39;re going to throw up.  You close your eyes, trying to pretend, you&#39;re not here.  You let him slide in and out.  There&#39;s no point in resisting.  He&#39;s going to get what he wants.  The only thing you can do now is to get it over with.

&quot;Open your eyes, bitch,&quot; he growls above you, &quot;Look up at me as you taste it for the first time.&quot;

You slowly open your eyes, letting your gaze rest on his as he creeps into the back of your mouth.  The look in his eyes is a deep and all-consuming satisfaction.  Until you have accomplished your task, you belong to him and you both know it.

Do you like this?  Do you like having this horrible thing in your mouth?  Is he kidding?

You hear a woman moan in pleasure and for a moment you panic at the thought of someone else seeing you in this position.  Then you panic for a different reason.

The woman was you.

There&#39;s an unsatisfying squirt between your legs and you tremble.  You ARE enjoying this.  Oh God!  How can this be turning you on?

One of his hands brush back your long, &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; hair and you stare up at him  with your eyes.  He stares down at you with what can only be lust as your luscious, &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; lips ease up and down along him.

&quot;God you&#39;re a hot little slut,&quot; he mumbles, stroking your cheek as you pleasure him.  You&#39;re suddenly aware of every detail.  The frustrating tightness of the belt between your legs.  The tickling panties against your thighs.  The tautly pulled garter straps, gripping the &lt;&lt;print $stockings&gt;&gt; stockings.  Your pushed up chest.  The soft and slinky outfit.  The way your hair tickles your neck.  And most of all...the pulsing beast in your mouth.  Another moan escapes you.  What has this place done to you?

You try to turn your head to see who the intruder is, but the hands wrapped around your head keep you firmly impaled upon the staff in your mouth.  You roll your eyes desperate to know who has seen you in this horrible situation.  When Mr. Elliot steps into your vision you blush with shame and humiliation.

&quot;Nah, we&#39;re almost done,&quot; Mr. Martinez says, the thing in your mouth swelling to confirm the statement.

&quot;What do you think of our new, little &quot; &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;?&quot; Mr. Elliot asks.  He meets your eyes and you whimper in embarrassment.

&quot;She&#39;s a hot little thing,&quot; Mr. Martinez says.  His voice sounds strained above you.  His body is tensing and you tremble with fear of what&#39;s about to happen.

&quot;Well she may not be a full-fledged slut yet,&quot; Mr. Elliot chuckles plopping down at his desk behind you, &quot;But according to her data sheet, she has an...intimate knowledge of...male equipment.&quot;

You cringe at the suggestion of your real gender even as Mr. Elliot laughs again at your expense.  The man in your mouth seems oblivious to the joke, however.  All of his attention is riveted to the sight and sensation of your shiny, &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; lips wrapped around his manhood.

&quot;Should I add her to your list of possible girls?&quot; Mr. Elliot asks even as the thing in your mouth pulses once...twice...

&quot;Oh god yes!&quot; Mr. Martinez says.  You don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a response to the question or to the eruption in the back of your mouth.  Your best guess is that it was a response to both.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="215" name="m4_moan_no" tags="" position="600,2725">You look up at him with mournful eyes as you try to mumble no around the thing plugging your mouth.

&quot;Well, don&#39;t worry slut,&quot; he says, guiding your mouth up and down, &quot;You&#39;ll learn to love it.  You can&#39;t deny what you were obviously born to do.&quot;

You can feel the thing in your mouth begin to pulse and you know what&#39;s coming.  You brace yourself for the conclusion to this horrible encounter.  Even though you dread the inevitable explosion, at least then it will be over and this horrible man will release you from between his legs.  You stare up at him with your eyes, humiliation and shame giving way to anger.  How dare he do this to you?  Not for the first time, you think about biting him.  The threat of punishment though, combined with the idea of a mouthful of blood negates the idea instantly though.  All you can do is wait.  Wait for it to end...

You watch Mr. Martinez easily tuck his now deflated beast into his pants and slowly ease his zipper back up.&quot;She get&#39;s high marks from me,&quot; the horrible brute laughs, &quot;Look at her.  With those big, puppy-dog eyes she&#39;d make a killing at the club.&quot;

You turn your eyes to the ground ashamed.

&quot;I bet she&#39;d like to be a dancer,&quot; Mr. Elliot says as if you&#39;re not even in the room, &quot;Shakin&#39; that little ass of hers for money.&quot;

&quot;With the mouth she has on her, we&#39;d never need her to dance,&quot; Mr. Martinez says, &quot;We could just keep her in the back room for our...special clients.&quot;

You whimper in fear.  A vision of that future flashes into your head.  On your knees in front of man after man...and worse than the thought is the painful fullness in your chastity belt.

Finally the legs squeezed around you open and you scamper away on your hands and knees, huddling into the corner.  The men find this to be very funny.

&quot;Aw, I think I scared her,&quot; Mr. Martinez says.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Mr. Elliot laughs, &quot;She&#39;ll be back to her insolent, little disobedient self before you know it.  These sluts only have an attention span of a few minutes, you know?&quot;

Mr. Martinez laughs again offering an extended hand to Mr. Elliot.  They shake and continue their chatter as they move to the outer office.  You hear the door swing open and they exit to the hall leaving you alone.  Only then do you allow the dismayed sob to leave you lips.

You stare at the door, horrified at the idea of seeing Mr. Elliot again.  How can you face him now?  How could he have let that happen, knowing that you&#39;re really a guy?

You hear the outer door open and you realize you&#39;re trembling again.  You don&#39;t dare look up for fear of having to look into his face.

You see his feet enter the room and a fresh batch of tears begin to brew in your eyes.  You swallow hard, painfully aware of the residual taste in your mouth and throat.  You wonder if you will ever be able to NOT taste it...HIM...ever again.

You can feel his eyes on you, but you can&#39;t meet them.  Not now.  Maybe not ever again.

&quot;Get up,&quot; he growls.  You do as he asks.  You can&#39;t seem to muster up any resistance at all.

&quot;Come here,&quot; he says, his voice still low and commanding.  You curtsey, still without looking at him, and scamper quickly to his side.  He pats his legs and without question or hesitation you position yourself across him.  Your skirt slides up and you let it.  What is modesty after what just happened?

&quot;You&#39;ve done very good today, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; he says, his hand massaging your bare thigh.  Your eyes are still downcast, staring at his hand on your smooth skin, &quot;Normally our girls don&#39;t pleasure a man until their second or third day.  You should be proud of yourself.&quot;

The hand on your back, pulls you close to him in a hug.  Tears well in your eyes as your conflicting emotions battle each other.  Anger, humiliation, shame, embarrassment and fear are just a few of the waves of feeling rushing over you.  There are far too many to catalogue, but underneath them all is an undeniable need between your legs.  A need for release, both from the chastity belt and from the perpetual stimulation that you seem to be under.

Tears begin to flow down your cheeks and Mr. Elliot hugs you close.  You feel so small next to him, so helpless.

&quot;It&#39;s ok,&quot; he says, squeezing you tight, &quot;It&#39;ll get easier.&quot;

This only makes you cry harder.  You don&#39;t WANT it to get easier.  You just want to go home.  To be out of this dreadful place.  Doesn&#39;t he understand?

&quot;It&#39;s been a long, eventful day for you,&quot; he says, stroking your cheek, wiping the tears away, &quot;Miss Payne will be here soon.  She&#39;ll get you out of those clothes, you&#39;ll get some rest and everything will seem better, ok?&quot;

You sniffle.  Is it over?  Is the horrible day over?  Is it ACTUALLY time to go home?

He raises your chin with his hand, forcing your eyes to make contact with his.  You&#39;re scared of what you&#39;ll see, but when you finally meet his gaze, its not as bad as you feared.

&quot;You sure do look pretty,&quot; he says, still holding your head up, &quot;I wasn&#39;t sure about you this afternoon, you know?  What with you...being a guy and all...&quot;

He caresses your back through the flimsy blouse.

&quot;But you don&#39;t act like a guy.  And you sure don&#39;t LOOK like a guy.&quot;  His hand leaves your chin and rests back upon your thigh.  He holds your gaze as if you&#39;re a mesmerized snake.

&quot;...and knowing that you&#39;re really a guy...when you look and act like you do...&quot; The hand on your thigh slides down between your legs and you squirm.  You can&#39;t take this anymore...you need release.  Every molecule of your body screams in agony.  Your panties don&#39;t even attempt to contain the liquid escaping the belt.  His hand tickles that infernal, tiny hole between your legs and you writhe around squeezing your legs around his hand.

&quot;...and what makes it SO perfect,&quot; he says whispering in your ear as his hand teases you mercilessly, &quot;Is that there is nothing you can do about any of it.&quot;

You whimper again, grinding against his hand.  You NEED release.  You have to have it.

&quot;I can do anything I want to you, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; he whispers, &quot;Tie you up, strip you down, use you any way I want to...&quot;

You shudder at his words, even as your body betrays you and squirts again against his hand. You&#39;re almost there, just a little bit more...

&quot;I can make you beg...or cry...or moan...&quot;

As if on cue, the whimpering moan escapes your lips.  You&#39;re there.  You made it.  Finally a release, despite the damned belt.

You tremble waiting for the wash of pleasure that you&#39;ve been building to ALL day.

It doesn&#39;t come.

The thing between your legs squirts out spurt after spurt of creamy fluid and there is no satisfaction.  No sense of relief. And worse...

Worse, his hand CONTINUES to stimulate you.

&quot;NO!&quot; you cry out in agony before reverting back to your muttered whimperings, &quot;...no...no...&quot;

&quot;Still horny, aren&#39;t you slut?&quot; Mr. Elliot snickers into your ear, &quot;I was wondering if your belt would work like the other girls&#39;.  But then we can&#39;t have you satisfied, can we?&quot;

His hand continues to stimulate, working your body up again to its fevered pitch.  If anything you&#39;re even more desperate now.  How can there not be ANY sense of climax...of release...

&quot;It must be especially bad for you though,&quot; Mr. Elliot whispers, &quot;I can only imagine how...frustrating...it must be. All that build up with no...payoff...&quot;

Impossibly, you pass the point again, squirting ineffectually over and over and STILL no satisfaction.  Liquid streams down your legs and you know his fingers must be covered, but despite the discharge you&#39;re still uncontrollably randy.  Every little twitch of his hand now sends tingles through your body and you moan in agony.

Then the hand withdraws and you writhe in discomfort and frustration.  The belt HAS to come off.  You can&#39;t take it anymore.

&quot;...please...&quot; you whimper, &quot;...please...get it off...I need it off...I can&#39;t take it...&quot;

&quot;What and ruin the fun?&quot; he laughs.  He plops one of his fingers into your pleading mouth and you taste your own juices on it. &quot;Besides.  Only Miss Payne has the key, and she should be here any...&quot;

As if on cue, Miss Payne bursts into the room.  The thought that SHE can get this infernal belt off of you overpowers ANY negative feeling you have for her.

&quot;Speak of the devil,&quot; Mr. Elliot laughs, &quot;She&#39;s all yours as soon as she cleans me up a little.&quot; 

The finger in your mouth wiggles and you wrap your lips around it.  The disgust at having to clean your own juice off his fingers is overpowered by your need to follow Miss Payne and get this horrible belt off.  And then you&#39;ll be free.  You can go home and try and forget this whole HORRIBLE day!

A second finger slides into your mouth, then the third.  Then with a slightly painful smack on your ass, you&#39;re propelled off his lap.

&quot;I&#39;ll come see you after surgery tomorrow, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; he says grinning, &quot;She&#39;s getting &lt;&lt;print $breast_size&gt;&gt;-cups, Payne.&quot;

Miss Payne just snickers and rolls her eyes.  You shiver at the thought, but they must be crazy if they think you&#39;re EVER coming back to this place again.  Contract or not, you&#39;re finished.

You can&#39;t help but fidget back and forth like an excited puppy as Ms. Payne hands Mr. Elliot a stack of papers and asks about your performance.  You listen to the humiliating account of what happened, barely able to focus at all.  Can&#39;t this woman hurry up!

&quot;Well then,&quot; Miss Payne says shaking her head at your fidgeting, &quot;Let me get this horny little slut downstairs before she wets herself again.&quot;

You&#39;re so grateful that you curtsey, which only makes them laugh for some reason.

&quot;Bye &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; Mr. Elliot says, &quot;See you tomorrow.&quot;

You curtsey to him, almost while you&#39;re moving behind Miss Payne.

You follow her back down the twisty hallway.  When you see Becky in the elevator your face lights up into a smile.  Everything seems so much better now that its five o&#39;clock.  Now that you&#39;re going home.

Becky smiles back at you and you feel a sudden kinship with the girl.  After all, with everything you&#39;ve gone through today, you DO have a kinship with her.  The elevator door slides shut and the three of you rocket back to floor number nine.

You&#39;re not sure exactly what to do, so by default you stand where you are.  You shift from one uncomfortable heel to the other, horribly aware of the humiliating outfit you&#39;re squeezed into.

&quot;Thanks for taking the time to see us,&quot; the curly-haired brunette says, shaking hands with Miss Worthington, &quot;I&#39;m Maxine and this is my sister Rebecca.&quot;  The shorter woman shakes hands and then the two of them sit in the chairs facing the desk.  You glance over at the guy who came in with them and catch him gazing at your legs.  His eyes quickly dash away and a blush as red as your own darkens his cheeks.

&quot;So what can I do for you ladies today?&quot; Miss Worthington asks.  She sits behind her desk as the two ladies look at each other.  You and the guy who came with them seem to have been completely forgotten.  You can feel him staring at you.  You shift your feet, afraid to look up for fear of catching his eye again.

&quot;Now, now ladies,&quot; Miss Worthington laughs, &quot;Don&#39;t be shy.  Would you like a drink?&quot;

&quot;Oh God, yes!&quot; Rebecca says.  You wonder why she&#39;s so nervous.  She&#39;s not the one dressed like the office tart, after all.

&quot;&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;!&quot; Miss Worthington barks, &quot;Fetch these ladies a glass of white wine please!&quot;  You jump at the sound of your name, curtseying without even thinking about it. You look around and spot the minibar in the corner.  The creepy guy&#39;s eyes follow your every move.

The bottle of white wine is in the minifridge under the bar and you wrestle the cork out with the corkscrew.  

&quot;The truth is, I need a secretary,&quot; Maxine says, &quot;Rebecca has that poor excuse of a husband of hers to help her out, but I&#39;m stuck having to answer my own phone.&quot;

You glance over as you pour the wine to see the guy looking at you again.  Why does he let that woman talk about him that way?  And why is staring at you?

&quot;I don&#39;t suppose you have any big and hunky, MALE secretaries hidden around here do you?&quot; Maxine laughs.  Miss Worthington just shoots her a sly smile and leans back in her chair.

&quot;Nope.  None of those, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; Miss Worthington says.  You mince over to the ladies and hand them glasses of wine.  You look over at the guy to see if he might like a glass and find him staring at you again.  You decide that if he&#39;s going to ogle you, then he won&#39;t get any wine.

&quot;But if it&#39;s a male secretary you want,&quot; Miss Worthington says, &quot;We might have something that would interest you.&quot;

Your eyes widen.  Oh no...she&#39;s going to tell them...

The two women are nodding their agreement and Miss Worthington waves you over with two fingers.  Horrified, you scamper over next to her and curtsey.

&quot;Ladies, I&#39;d like you to meet &lt;&lt;print $name_first&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;print $name_last&gt;&gt;.  Say hello, &lt;&lt;print $name_first&gt;&gt;.&quot;

You mutter a horribly embarrasing hello.  They all stare at you, eyes wide and mouths ajar.  But no one is more shocked than the guy.  You&#39;re afraid that his eyes are going to pop out of his head.

&quot;No way!&quot; Rebecca mutters.  Maxine is not so subtle, &quot;NO WAY!!!&quot;

&quot;I promise you ladies,&quot; Miss Worthington says, &quot;&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;, here, walked into our building this morning 100% male.  She&#39;s still got quite a bit of training left to do, but I think you can see the potential...&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t believe it!&quot; Maxine says, shaking her head, &quot;What are you trying to pull?&quot;

&quot;Go on.  Feel her neck under the collar,&quot; Miss Worthington says pushing you forward towards the women.  You teeter on the heels only to be caught by Maxine.  Her fingers probe your throat and press roughly against your Adam&#39;s apple.

&quot;I&#39;ll be damned,&quot; Maxine says, grabbing one of your breasts experimentally, &quot;These aren&#39;t real, are they?&quot;

&quot;Not yet,&quot; Miss Worthington says.  Your head whips around to look at her and she winks at you.

&quot;Do you like looking like this?&quot; the woman groping your breast asks.

You bite your lower lip.  You&#39;re being sold like a piece of meat.

&quot;She still has a month left at least,&quot; Miss Worthington says, &quot;Probably more since she&#39;s such a mouthy, little tramp.&quot;

A month!  Dear lord.  As soon as they let you out of this chastity belt you are going to get just as far from this place as possible.  This day alone feels like its lasted years.

&quot;But fair warning,&quot; Miss Worthington continues, &quot;She&#39;s going to be expensive.  She&#39;s getting bids on her already and like I said its only her first day.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry.  I can go pretty high,&quot; Maxine says.  Her eyes roll over you with an evil gleam.  &quot;I wanted a guy to be my secretary, but this is even better.  Does he still have his...you know...equipment?&quot;

Miss Worthington pulls up your skirt and raps her knuckles on your chastity belt.

&quot;All tightly locked away.  She can still use the bathroom, but there is NO room for any male impulses.&quot; She drops your skirt back and you can&#39;t help but cringe as another squirt of liquid soaks into your panties.  This belt is intolerable. &quot;And just like the belts we put on our girls, it keeps her in a perpetually horny state.  Feel her panties...go on...remember you&#39;re in charge.&quot;

How can they be treating you like this?  This can&#39;t be legal!

The woman&#39;s hand goes between your legs and your body betrays you and squirts.

&quot;He&#39;s soaking wet!&quot; Maxine says laughing.  You blush again in shame.

&quot;But there&#39;s no climax to it,&quot; Miss Worthington says smiling, &quot;Perpetual horniness with no conclusion.  It makes them VERY docile.&quot;

You pout as the ruffles on your panties cause another squirt.  Docile!?!  You feel like you&#39;re about to explode!

&quot;Well I&#39;ve made up my mind,&quot; Maxine says, &quot;Email me when she&#39;s ready for auction and I&#39;ll place a bid.&quot;

&quot;Wonderful,&quot; Miss Worthington says.  She stands up and shakes hands with Maxine. &quot;I&#39;ll keep you up-to-date on her training.  Thanks for stopping by.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Maxine says, &quot;Rebecca?  Let&#39;s go.&quot;

The other woman doesn&#39;t move.

&quot;You said that &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt; was the first guy you&#39;ve ever done this to?&quot; she asks softly.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Miss Worthington says, &quot;She was hired as a clerical error and rather than deal with the potential sexual discrimination lawsuit, Miss Payne thought it best to...&quot;

&quot;Will you be training other males?&quot; Rebecca interrupts.

Everyone is looking at Rebecca now, including you.  She seems uncomfortable with the attention. 

&quot;I suppose we might.  &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt; seems to be turning out ok, so...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like for you to train my husband...&quot;

The room erupts into chaos.  Her husband sputters behind her.  Maxine laughs loudly and Miss Worthington chuckles.

&quot;Now listen here...&quot; her husband says, his voice nasal and whining, &quot;If you think for one second that I would EVER dress up like this little fairy...&quot; he points to you.

&quot;Bradley!  Shut up!&quot; Maxine yells.  He doesn&#39;t even hear her.

&quot;Is this what you want?&quot; he screams, &quot;Is this what you WANT?  Fine.  Take him.  I&#39;m out of here!&quot;

He tries to go to the door and finds it has no handle.  He wheels around, his eyes wide with panic and anger and storms back to Miss Worthington.

&quot;Let me out of here!&quot; he screams, &quot;I want out of this place right n...&quot;

Before you can blink, Miss Worthington has pulled the man&#39;s arm behind his back and pushed him face down on top of her desk.  He screams in outrage, but she twists his arm until it dies out.

&quot;Now you will be silent while we discuss this,&quot; she says softly into his ear.  He whimpers, but says nothing else.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="221" name="f4_nodhead" tags="" position="100,2850">You nod your head miserably. What else can you do?  The word &#39;no&#39; isn&#39;t allowed in your vocabulary.

&quot;&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;!&quot; Miss Worthington yells, &quot;She asked you a question.  Answer her correctly and don&#39;t forget your manners!&quot;

&quot;Yes Ma&#39;am&quot; you say, curtseying.  Then you realize that that was just the correct the response to Miss Worthington.  You still have to respond to Maxine.

&quot;Yes Ma&#39;am&quot; you say again.  You drop another curtsey and all the women laugh at you.  You blush with embarrassment.  You&#39;ve got to out of this madhouse. &lt;&lt;include &#39;f4_sold_text&#39;&gt;&gt;

There is a momentary silence as everyone stares at you.  As if in slow motion, Miss Worthington stands up.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll have to excuse, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; she says walking over toward you, &quot;Remember this is still her first day.  She hasn&#39;t been properly trained yet.&quot;

Her hand grabs the back of your neck, and suddenly you find your face pressed down against her desk.  You whimper as she pulls your skirt up onto your back and you squirm under her grip as the cool air hits your bare skin.

&quot;Would you ladies care to help me teach this little slut a lesson?&quot; Miss Worthington asks sweetly.  You squirm harder, but she has you pinned so effectively that all you can do is writhe around.

&quot;Now, now ladies...don&#39;t be shy.  Discipline is important for a good secretary.  They need to learn when to keep their big mouths shut.  Isn&#39;t that right, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;?&quot;

You whimper again.  Your ass still burns from the last spanking.  You don&#39;t think you can take anymore of this.

&quot;I&#39;ll do it,&quot; Maxine says behind you.  You tremble with fear.  You wish they&#39;d just hurry up and get it over with.

&quot;Give her two dozen good whacks.  Leniency only breeds more of this kind of behavior.

Then it begins.  You are squealing by the third one and crying by the fifth.  Maxine doesn&#39;t hold back, each one more painful than the last.  Then its done and you hear your sobs hitch in relief.

&quot;Rebecca?&quot; Miss Worthington says still holding your neck, &quot;Your turn.&quot;

Oh lord...not more...

&quot;I couldn&#39;t...&quot; you hear Rebecca say softly.  You silently bless her for her kindness.

&quot;I&#39;ll do it,&quot; the guy says.  Your spirits sink.

&quot;Bradley, you&#39;d better shut up!&quot; Maxine growls, but then you hear Rebecca clear her throat.

&quot;On second thought, I will do it, Miss Worthington.&quot;

What?

&quot;I need to learn how to PROPERLY spank MY secretary...&quot; her words throw daggers at her husband, &quot;Will you please correct my technique for me?&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Miss Worthington says, &quot;First make sure that you hold nothing back.  Go on and try.&quot;

You howl in pain.

&quot;Put your whole arm into the next one, and keep your hand flat...

Tears run down your cheeks...

When you&#39;re finally allowed to stand, your whole body is numb.  You sniff, trying to regain your composure. &lt;&lt;include &#39;f4_sold_text&#39;&gt;&gt;&#39;

&quot;Why not?&quot; Rebecca says coldly, &quot;He&#39;s not much use as he is.  I think he could certainly use some...training&quot;

Bradley whimpers under Miss Worthington&#39;s grip.

&quot;There are a few things you should know before you make this decision,&quot; Miss Worthington says, &quot;First of all, we train our girls for obedience. If you do this, the next time you see your husband, he won&#39;t be your husband anymore...he&#39;ll be your secretary.&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; Rebecca says, her voice as cold as ice.

&quot;Rebecca please...&quot; Bradley moans, only to be cut off as Miss Worthington grinds his neck harder with her fingers.

&quot;Secondly, it is our company policy that all of our girls go to auction.  Bradley will be no different.  Should you be outbid...&quot;

Her words trail off and Maxine and Rebecca look at each other.

&quot;You can have every cent of my auction money,&quot; Maxine tells her, &quot;We&#39;ll get him back one way or the other.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Rebecca says.  Her voice is quivering, yet the coldness is still there. &quot;We&#39;ll pay a fair price.  If we lose, then someone will obviously have more use for him than we do.&quot;

Bradley begins to sob.

&quot;Well if you&#39;ve made up your mind...&quot; Miss Worthington says.

&quot;I have...&quot;

&quot;&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;, in my bottom left desk drawer is a length of cord.  Fetch it for me.&quot;

You curtsey and scamper to the desk.  As you bend over to open the drawer, your eyes lock with Bradley, still bent over the desk.  You feel horribly sorry for him, but what can you do?

Then you see it.

Sitting innocently on the top of Miss Worthington&#39;s desk.

The keycard that opens the door.  This could be your chance.  She has her hands full with Bradley, and the other women aren&#39;t in any position to stop you.  You might be able to escape.

You make a mental note not to do anything wrong around Miss Worthington, ever again.

You bring the cord back to the other side of the desk, and in seconds, Miss Worthington has Bradley trussed up, his hands behind his back and tethered to his ankles.  Only then does she let him up off the desk.  The poor man can barely walk, not that he even tries.  He just looks at his wife, big tears running down his face.

&quot;Rebecca please...&quot;

&quot;Shhh,&quot; Rebecca says, putting a finger to his lips, &quot;This is for the best Bradley.  It won&#39;t be so bad.  Maybe you&#39;ll even like it.&quot;

Maxine sniggers and Bradley&#39;s face turns red with anger and outrage.

Before he can say anything though, the door bursts open and Miss Payne storms in.

&quot;Ah, ladies, I&#39;d like you to meet our secretarial manager, Miss Payne.&quot;

They shake hands, while you and Bradley stand there, completely ignored.

&quot;Bradley here has just been hired into the Pool.  Will you be kind enough to escort him down to the breakroom and get him thoroughly orientated?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Miss Payne says, grabbing ahold of Bradleys tied wrists, &quot;I will need one of you ladies to come with me and fill out some paper work.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do it,&quot; Maxine says.  The woman has an evil smile on her face.  &quot;After all, what is a sister-in-law for?&quot; 

Miss Payne nods toward Miss Worthington.  &quot;And you might want to go clear this with the boss.&quot;

&quot;Yes I suppose so.&quot; Miss Worthington says, &quot;&lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;, get Rebecca another drink and keep her company while we&#39;re gone.&quot;

You curtsey and hurry to the bar, even as they begin to file out of the room.  You hear Bradley offer up one final, scared, &quot;Rebecca?&quot; before being escorted down the hall and out of sight.  You bring Rebecca a glass of wine, and she takes it without a word.  You stand there, unsure of what to do and time ticks by incredibly slow.

&quot;Was I wrong to do that?&quot; She asks softly, her eyes turn toward you and you see they&#39;re filled with tears, &quot;He was cheating on me, you know?  I&#39;ve known about it for months and I&#39;ve done nothing.&quot;

Now you feel sorry for her as well.  She&#39;s obviously pretty broken up about this.  At the same time, she just gave her husband to this horrible company to turn into an office girl, just like you.

&quot;Well?&quot; she asks, her voice harder and angrier now, &quot;Am I an evil person?  Say something...&quot;


[[Tell her &quot;I&#39;m sure he deserved it.&quot;|f4_deservedit][$score_sub += 1]]

Tears suddenly explode from her eyes and she bounds to her feet, wrapping her arms around you.  You hug her as she weeps on your shoulder.

&quot;He&#39;ll be ok, right?  Tell me he&#39;ll be ok?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;ll be ok,&quot; you tell her patting her back softly.

Her tears slowly reign themselves back in and she pulls away.  Her hand goes up and traces your cheek.

&quot;You&#39;re so sweet,&quot; she sniffles, &quot;If he turns out half as good as you...&quot;

You blush and look away, unsure of what to say.

&quot;You really are very pretty,&quot; she says, stroking your hair, &quot;I had no idea...that you were...are...I mean...&quot;

&quot;Stop crying this instant!&quot;

The voice startles both of you and you turn to look.

She dips her hand into the dreaded bottom drawer of her desk and pulls out a long length of chain.  She calmly takes a step towards you with it and panic wraps itself tightly around your heart.

&quot;Its about control, Rebecca,&quot; she says striding over to you.  You cringe away from her, but as the wall hits your back you realize there is nowhere to go.  &quot;They have to know that you&#39;re in charge and that whatever you tell them to do...must be done without question.&quot;

She opens a loop in the end of the chain and in one fluid movement, she slides it over your head.  Your hands go to your neck in horror.  The woman just put you on a leash!

Without warning, she leaps to her feet and slaps you across the face.  Its so unexpected that you just stand there for a second, staring at her.

&quot;I&#39;m...sorry,&quot; she mutters, under her breath, &quot;I...I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing...I...&quot;

&quot;Never apologize, Rebecca.&quot;

She sits at her desk, pulls out her keyboard and begins to type.  Rebecca just looks at you for what seems like forever.  Your eyes send pleading messages to her.  How can they treat you like this?

&quot;What should I have her do?&quot; she asks, her voice no longer timid.

&quot;Whatever you want.  The stupid-little thing hasn&#39;t been trained in much of anything yet, but she seems eager enough.  Have her clean your shoes.&quot;

Rebecca&#39;s eyes sparkle.

The chain cinches around your neck and you squeak in pain and scramble over to her on all fours.  She&#39;s not holding back.  Your neck aches.  You already know that whatever she asks of you, you&#39;ll do without question.

She holds her shoe out in front of your face.

Miss Worthington yanks the chain hard and the loop constricts around your neck.  You sputter, your words dying in your throat.  Then you&#39;re on the floor, panting and wheezing on all fours no better than a dog.

&quot;This can&#39;t be happening,&quot; you think as you gasp for air, &quot;Now I&#39;m not even a girl...I&#39;m just an animal to them...&quot;

You lean close to the two inch, black leather pump, your eyes still looking up pitifully at Rebecca.  She jingles the chain in her hand as if to say, &quot;hurry up&quot;.

You take a handful of your wavy, &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; hair in your hand and then tilt your head to the side and begin to shine her shoes.  You catch a glimpse of your reflection in the mirror behind the bar and blush with humiliation.  The girl in the mirror is the picture of submission, her big puppy-dog eyes wide with fear and shame.  You can&#39;t help but watch the sexy, little secretary reflection as she kneels there.  Her skirt draped across her sexy legs, her long, &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; nails clutching a handful of luxurious, &lt;&lt;print $hair_color&gt;&gt; hair.  And perhaps sexiest of all...

The chain leash around her neck.

You would kill to have a girl that looked like that on a leash between your legs.  At the same time, never in a million years would you have thought to BE that girl.

Rebecca crosses her legs and you begin work on her other foot.  Your eyes leave the mirror to study her face again.

She is smiling.  It is a smile of complete and utter satisfaction and it makes you feel cheap and used.  You&#39;re polishing her shoes with your own hair and she&#39;s ok with it!

You look down at the shoe you&#39;re working on.  It does look shinier, although you can&#39;t imagine how much good you actually did.

You don&#39;t hesitate.  You press your lips against the shiny leather.  She giggles with satisfaction.

&quot;Oooh, I like this!&quot; she tells Miss Worthington, &quot;I like this a lot.&quot;

&quot;Feels pretty good, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; Miss Worthington asks as she continues to type.

Rebecca smiles at you and pulls you gently over to kneel beside her legs.  Her hand presses your face against her outer thigh and she pets your hair, running her fingers through it gently.

&quot;Good girl,&quot; she says, her voice dripping with condescension, &quot;You&#39;ve given me lots of good ideas for Bradley.&quot;

You&#39;re still kneeling beside her, your face in her lap when Maxine comes back in.  She sits beside Rebecca.  She glances at you curiously, but says nothing.

&quot;We need to make some decisions about Bra...I mean Crystal.&quot;

Your mind flashes back to the breakroom.  Poor Bradley got the locker next to yours.

&quot;Crystal,&quot; Rebecca chuckles, &quot;I like that.  How very...ditzy.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, fitting, ain&#39;t it?&quot; Maxine laughs.  &quot;Anyway, he&#39;s gonna need some surgery to fit in around here...he&#39;s not quite as naturally girly as your lapdog I guess.&quot;

The hand in your hair pats your head and you wince.  You&#39;re NOT girly...THEY&#39;VE made you look like this.

&quot;They&#39;re gonna do some massive stuff on his face, but they&#39;re going to let us decide what we want his body to look like.  Here, I have samples.&quot;

She shows Rebecca the sheet of paper in her hand.  You stare at it in horror.  They wouldn&#39;t really turn Bradley into THAT would they?

&quot;So we could give him an hourglass figure...basically big tits, tiny waist, big ass.  Or this one here might be fun.  Get this, they call it bootylicious...they leave the top small, shrink the waist and then SERIOUSLY pump up his backside.  Or there&#39;s this one here.  Top Heavy.  They leave the lower part alone and over-emphasize the tits...&quot;

&quot;Poor Bradley,&quot; Rebecca giggles, &quot;He&#39;s going to be VERY popular isn&#39;t he?&quot;

&quot;She,&quot; Miss Worthington says without looking up.  This causes the other two women to laugh loudly.

You stare up in horror.  First your eyes go to Miss Worthington, who looks at you as if you&#39;re completely insignificant.  Then as the panic sets in your eyes dart back to Rebecca.  She stares down at you with cold satisfaction.

&quot;Well it seems to me that since she helped decide what Crystal should look like, that she should look the same...&quot;

You start to protest in anger, but the jerk on your collar turns it into a sob and then a whimper.  They can&#39;t seriously be talking about giving you surgery!  This can&#39;t be happening!

&quot;Very good,&quot; Miss Worthington says, &quot;You&#39;re starting to get the hang of this.&quot;

The other two ladies stand and you scramble on all fours as Rebecca steps forward, to keep the chain from cinching around your neck.

&quot;The auction for both &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt; here, as well as Crystal, should be in about two weeks.  I&#39;ll email you with an exact date as soon as I have one.

The ladies shake hands and Rebecca hands Miss Worthington your leash.

&quot;Thanks for this,&quot; Rebecca says, indicating you, &quot;You&#39;re doing a very good job with her.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Miss Worthington says, &quot;I think she&#39;ll turn out just fine.&quot;

The women head toward the reception area and you scramble madly to keep up, the carpet rough against your knees.  Before you can get through the door, Miss Worthington slips the end of your leash over the outside of the door handle and maneuvers the door shut.  The chain leash slides down into the space beneath the door, and as the latch clicks you find yourself trapped, unable to raise your head more than a foot off the floor.  You try to pull away from the door, but the other end is firmly attached to the doorknob on the opposite side of the door.  You whimper in frustration and mounting dread.  They can&#39;t really give you plastic surgery, can they?

But then again, this morning you wouldn&#39;t have thought they could have made you look like a beautiful girl and chained you on all fours, tied to a door.  Tears begin to trickle down your face as you wait for Miss Worthington to come back.

Maxine laughs so hard a tear trickles down her cheek.

&quot;What size breasts does this choice give hi...I mean her?&quot; Rebecca asks.

&quot;After all is said and done, she&#39;ll probably end up with about a Double D,&quot; Miss Worthington says, &quot;They&#39;ll be big, don&#39;t worry.&quot;

&quot;I can do anything I want to you, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; she whispers, &quot;Tie you up, strip you down, use you any way I want to...&quot;

You shudder at her words, even as your body betrays you and squirts again against her hand. You&#39;re almost there, just a little bit more...

&quot;I can make you beg...or cry...or moan...&quot;

As if on cue, the whimpering moan escapes your lips.  You&#39;re there.  You made it.  Finally a release, despite the damned belt.

You tremble waiting for the wash of pleasure that you&#39;ve been building to ALL day.

It doesn&#39;t come.

The thing between your legs squirts out spurt after spurt of creamy fluid and there is no satisfaction.  No sense of relief. And worse...

Worse, her hand CONTINUES to stimulate you.

&quot;NO!&quot; you cry out in agony before reverting back to your muttered whimperings, &quot;...no...no...&quot;

&quot;Still horny, aren&#39;t you slut?&quot; Miss Worthington snickers into your ear, &quot;We can&#39;t have you satisfied, can we?&quot;

Her hand continues to stimulate, working your body up again to its fevered pitch.  If anything you&#39;re even more desperate now.  How can there not be ANY sense of climax...of release...

&quot;It must be especially bad for you &#39;new&#39; girls though,&quot; Miss Worthington whispers, &quot;I can only imagine how...frustrating...it must be. All that build up with no...payoff...&quot;

Impossibly, you pass the point again, squirting ineffectually over and over and STILL no satisfaction.  Liquid streams down your legs and you know her fingers must be covered, but despite the discharge you&#39;re still uncontrollably horny.  Every little twitch of her hand now sends tingles through your body and you moan in agony.

Then the hand withdraws and you writhe in uncomfort and frustration.  The belt HAS to come off.  You can&#39;t take it anymore.

&quot;...please...&quot; you whimper, &quot;...please...get it off...I need it off...I can&#39;t take it...&quot;

&quot;What and ruin the fun?&quot; she laughs.  She plops one of her fingers into your pleading mouth and you taste your own juices on it. &quot;Besides.  Only Miss Payne has the key, and she should be here any...&quot;

As if on cue, Miss Payne bursts into the room.  The thought that SHE can get this infernal belt off of you overpowers ANY negative feeling you have for her.

&quot;Speak of the devil,&quot; Miss Worthington laughs, &quot;She&#39;s all yours as soon as she cleans me up a little.&quot; 

The finger in your mouth wiggles and you wrap your lips around it.  The disgust at having to clean your own juice off her fingers is overpowered by your need to follow Miss Payne and get this horrible belt off.  Then you&#39;ll be free.  You can go home and try and forget this whole HORRIBLE day!

A second finger slides into your mouth, then the third.  Then with a slightly painful smack on your ass, she pulls away.

&quot;I&#39;ll come see you after surgery tomorrow, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; she says grinning, &quot;She&#39;s getting the &lt;&lt;print $breast_size&gt;&gt; package, Payne.&quot;

Miss Payne just snickers and rolls her eyes.  You shiver at the thought, but they must be crazy if they think you&#39;re EVER coming back to this place again.  Contract or not, you&#39;re finished.

You can&#39;t help but fidget back and forth like an excited puppy as Ms. Payne hands Miss Worthington a stack of papers and asks about your performance.  You listen to the humiliating account of what happened, barely able to focus at all.  Can&#39;t this woman hurry up!

&quot;Well then,&quot; Miss Payne says shaking her head at your fidgeting, &quot;Let me get this horny little slut downstairs before she wets herself again.&quot;

You&#39;re so grateful that you curtsey, which only makes them laugh for some reason.

&quot;Bye &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot; Miss Worthington says, &quot;See you tomorrow.&quot;

You curtsey to her, almost while you&#39;re moving behind Miss Payne.

You follow her back down the twisty hallway.  When you see Becky in the elevator your face lights up into a smile.  Everything seems so much better now that its five o&#39;clock.  Now that you&#39;re going home.

Becky smiles back at you and you feel a sudden kinship with the girl.  After all, with everything you&#39;ve gone through today, you DO have a kinship with her.  The elevator door slides shut and the three of you rocket back to floor number nine.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="252" name="f4_deny_it" tags="" position="225,3225">You shake your head, afraid to actually utter the word &quot;no&quot;.

She chuckles, her hand tickling your thighs.  The moan that erupts from your lips makes it sound as if you&#39;re being tortured.  Which in a way you are.

She pulls her hand away and you whimper. She slides it back into position and you moan, arching your back against her, feeling her soft, hot breath on your neck.

Why are you acting like this?  Is this what you really are?  A wanton slut more easily turned on than a bitch in heat?  You shiver as her fingers twirl around the tiny hole in the belt.  You hear a soft feminine whimpering that is so loud in your head that it can only be coming from your own voice.

Her hot body presses against you.  You can feel her breasts, soft and supple against your back.  It&#39;s too much.

The door on the other side of the room pops open and you dash for it madly, ignoring the angry scream of Miss Worthington behind you.  The two other women simply turn and watch as you teeter into the outer office.  You push the button again, aiming it at the second door and it pops open just as easily.  You slam shut the door behind you.  Without the keycard, the horrid women are trapped in there.  At least until someone comes to let them out and with any luck you&#39;ll be LONG gone by then.

That&#39;s when it hits you.

You have NO idea which way the elevator is. You have NO idea where to find a key for this chastity belt.  You have NO idea how you&#39;re going to get home with no money or ID.  Maybe you should have thought this through more.

The angry yelling on the other side of the closed door reminds you that it&#39;s too late for second thoughts.  You turn right and decide to follow that old rule about mazes.  Keep turning right until you find your way out.

The hallways twist and turn and just when everything seems the most hopeless, you see the elevator down the end of a hallway to your left.

You scamper toward it, the blasted shoes killing your aching feet.  All you have to do is take the elevator to the ground floor, hurry out of the building and get a few blocks away.  Then you&#39;ll figure out how to get home and how to get out of this infernal chastity device.

You swipe the card.

Nothing happens.

You swipe it again...and again...

Nothing.

They must have deactivated it somehow.  You&#39;re trapped.  They&#39;re going to catch you and...

You take a deep breath.  They really have turned you into a stupid airhead.

You turn the card the other direction and swipe it.  The elevator dings and the light indicates that it is descending to your floor.  Stupid.  Stupid.  Stupid.

Keep your head.  That&#39;s what you have to do, just keep your head.

The elevator dings and the doors slide open.

Just keep calm and don&#39;t draw any attention to yourself.  You step into the elevator car and slide the card again.  The doors slide shut and you breath a sigh of relief as you press the button for the lobby.

You&#39;re almost free.  With each floor number that ticks off, you&#39;re that much closer to being out of this madhouse.  Nine, eight, seven, si...

Ding.

The doors begin to slide open.  Oh God.

You assume a submissive position, hoping that whoever sees you will just overlook you and let you continue on your way.

&quot;Well, well, well...&quot; she says.

Tears fill your eyes.  No.  It just isn&#39;t fair.  You were so close.

&quot;So where are you going, little &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;?&quot; Miss Payne asks.


[[&quot;I&#39;m on an errand for Miss Worthington.&quot;|f4_errand][$score_sub += 1]]

Sure.  That sounds plausible.  Maybe she&#39;ll buy it and...

&quot;What could Miss Worthington POSSIBLY need from the lobby?&quot; she asks stepping into the car, crowding next to you, &quot;And WHY would ANY manager give an airheaded slut like you a keycard?&quot;

You shake with fear as she looms over you.  You shrink back against the wall and yet she&#39;s still too close.

&quot;I think that you stole that keycard, and that you were trying to run out on your contract.  That&#39;s what I think.  Is that true, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;?&quot;

You nod your head.  She knew.  She always seems to know.  Damnit!

&quot;I&#39;m very disappointed.  Miss Worthington has been very kind and generous to take on such an incompetent ninny as a secretary and this is how you thank her?  Tsk.&quot;

Oh God!  She&#39;s going to punish you.  You can feel it coming.  Your ass aches in anticipation of the beating.

&quot;Well I guess we&#39;d better take you up to see Miss Daniels.  This is FAR to serious an infraction of the rules for me to handle.&quot;

She smirks at you, delighted to see you in this much trouble.  You&#39;re trembling all over.  After what this woman has done to you, the thought that she can&#39;t punish you as much as this other woman is terrifying.  She pulls the keycard out of your fingers and swipes it across the panel, punching the top button.  You instantly start zooming to the top floor, while you&#39;re heart goes the other direction.

She looms right over on top of you, forcing you to step back and cower against the back wall of the car.

&quot;You sure know how to burn bridges, don&#39;t you bitch.  Not only do you lock your own supervisor in her office, steal her property and try to smuggle M&amp;R property out of the building...&quot; she plucks at your blouse in disgust, &quot;but now you have the audacity to quit when you haven&#39;t even finished your first DAY!  You really are a lazy, ignorant SLUT aren&#39;t you?&quot;

Despite your fear, you&#39;ve had just about enough of this.  You take a deep breath, trying not to notice the swell of your tiny bossum, and get ready to yell at the horrible woman.  Before you can her hand goes to your face.  She puckers your lips into an &#39;O&#39; and without warning kisses you.  Her tongue slides into your mouth, while her hard body presses against you, pinning you to the wall of the car.  Her tongue darts into your mouth and despite the anger and fear that courses through your body, your panties dampen further.

You don&#39;t know what to say when she pulls her mouth back off of yours.  You do realize that she&#39;s taken the keycard out of your hands, but you&#39;re not sure when she did it.  She swipes it and pushes the top button on the elevator.  The car begins to zoom upward.  You&#39;re not sure what to say.  Hell you&#39;re not exactly sure what just happened.

&quot;You&#39;re a fiery little bitch,&quot; Miss Payne says chuckling as the car approaches the top floor of the building, &quot;I wish I could keep you, but you&#39;ve crossed the line.  You&#39;ll have to answer to the boss now.&quot;


[[Click here to continue.|f4_door][$image_name = &#39;default&#39;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="256" name="f4_door" tags="" position="725,3225">The door opens and your pounding heart goes even faster.  The hallway outside of the elevator is dim...practically dark.  You peer out onto the floor and a tiny pinpoint of pain burrows into your brain.  You furrow your brow tying to get rid of the sudden migrane.

&quot;Here we are,&quot; Miss Payne says, propelling you out into the darkness.  You stumble forward, reeling in the high heels, trying to get your balance.

Unlike the other hallways in this madhouse, this one only has one door at the very end.  It&#39;s a dark red color door, set into a light pink frame.  There are big, white letters reading: DANIELS printed on it.  For some reason the door causes the hair on the back of your neck to stand up.  You turn around, prepared to beg Miss Payne to let you go.

She&#39;s not there.

The elevator car is empty.  You&#39;re alone in the hallway.  You spin around again, confused.

Where could she have gone?  The elevator car is still there, and there&#39;s only one door at the end of the dark hallway.

Your skin pimples in gooseflesh.  You realize that you&#39;re trembling, your breath coming out in ragged gasps.  There is an absence of sound on this floor and you can hear the beating of your own heart in your ears.

You step back into the elevator, hoping to escape.

No good.  Wherever Payne disappeared to, she took the keycard.  There&#39;s only one place to go.

You approach the dark, red door...each step seeming to happen in slow motion.  The pinpoint of pain in your head gets larger and more intense as you near the colored rectangle.  You find it hard to look away from it.  The red color, draws your eye inward, the darkness of the hall causing it to pop out.

You stand before it, trembling.  You&#39;ve never felt less masculine in your life.  You feel small...helpless.  Out of control.  The tight clothing clings to your curves, to your skin as if it belongs there and underneath it...

Underneath, your little member throbs in its hard encasement.

You whimper in fear.  It&#39;s time to go inside.


[[Knock.|f4_knock][$score_sub += 1]]
[[Open the door.|f4_melissa]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="257" name="f4_knock" tags="" position="850,3225">Your delicate, little hand with the finely manicured nails slowly rises in front of you face.  You tap lightly on the door with your knuckles.  Barely a sound is made, but the tiny knock sounds like a hammer on the drums of doom.

There is no reply.

You knock three more times, the slightly louder sound pounding it&#39;s way into your brain.

Nothing.

You look back down the darkened hallway.  There&#39;s nowhere else to go.  You let your hand fall to the doorknob.


[[Open the door.|f4_melissa]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="258" name="f4_melissa" tags="" position="975,3225">The door knob is cool to the touch and turns easily in your grip.  The door creaks open and you find yourself staring into what looks like a small library.  The room is dark, lit only by a smoldering fireplace and a single candle.  Beside the candle sits the most beautiful woman you have ever seen.  She scribbles on a notebook, completely oblivious to your presence.

What is going on here?

The air is different in this room.  It smells heavy and wet almost like...

The room fills with a short burst of blue light which fills the four windows along the walls of the room.  Outside the window are trees...but how?  You&#39;re on the top floor of this building at least 30 stories up.  How can there be trees up here...

A crack of thunder cuts the thought short and you realize what the smell is.

Rain.

The woman rolls her neck and sits up stretching her back.  She reaches for the glass of wine on the table beside her and takes a deep sit of the dark red liquid.  As the glass returns to the table, her eyes find you.

They widen with surprise and she looks down at the tablet on her lap as if your name might be on it somewhere.

&quot;You?  What are you doing here?&quot; she says, her eyes going back up to you.

Your mind goes blank.  You can&#39;t think of what to say.

&quot;Oh for heaven&#39;s sake,&quot; she says, picking up her pencil and scribbling a sentence down on her tablet.

&quot;I was sent here for punishment,&quot; you say, the words streaming out of your mouth.  You curtsey in perfect form, your head hung in submission.  This woman has turned you into a cowering girl with no more than a handful of words.  And yet...this place makes no sense.  Another flash of lightning lights up the windows and you see a rolling plain outside.  How did you get here?  Did Miss Payne drug and kidnap you to this place?

&quot;This damn storm,&quot; she says taking another sip of wine, &quot;It&#39;s screwing everything up.  You were supposed to be sent to...ah hell what was his name?&quot; She flips through the notepad.  &quot;Morris.  Mr. Morris.  He was supposed to be the boss.  Damnit!&quot;

You shuffle your feet.  She&#39;s mad.  This can&#39;t be a good thing.  You should never have tried to escape.

&quot;Well, I guess it can&#39;t be helped now,&quot; she says, standing up and walking slowly toward you.  Your knees get shaky the closer this woman gets.  &quot;Well, come on.  Let&#39;s see how you&#39;re turning out.  Spin around for me.&quot;

Without even knowing you&#39;re going to do it, you execute a perfect girlish spin.  Your skirt flares up revealing your stocking tops.  You blush profusely as your eyes snap back around to catch the woman&#39;s.  They twinkle with humor.

&quot;Well it looks like you&#39;re turning out just fine.  A perfect girl.  And such a cute, little body too.  Look at you.&quot;

She caresses your cheek with a soft touch and the thing between your legs erupts, shooting hot goo down your legs.  You gasp in pleasure and surprise.  Her touch to the side of your face lasted no more than two seconds, but you can still feel it.  Your skin tingles.  The woman made you orgasm with no more than a two second caress to your cheek!  You feel faint.

&quot;I guess an explanation is in order.  After all, you&#39;ve wandered in here so you might as well learn something.  But have a seat first.  Over there by the fire.  What I have to tell you is pretty big scale and I don&#39;t want you fainting to the floor.&quot;

As if your body is stuck on auto-pilot, you move to the chair and sink into it.  You sit gracefully, your legs crossing automatically into the proper girlish position.  You look at them confused, wondering why you&#39;re sitting this way.  You try to uncross them and find that you really just don&#39;t want to.  What is going on???


[[Click here to continue.|f4_explanaton1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="259" name="f4_explanaton1" tags="" position="1100,3225">&quot;The first thing you need to know, &lt;&lt;print $name_first&gt;&gt;, is that you&#39;re not really here.&quot;

She sits back in her chair and takes another sip of her wine.  You blush at the sound of your real name.  Here you are dressed as this little office tart in front of this beautiful woman and worse...she knows who you are.

&quot;All of this,&quot; she says, indicating the room, &quot;This is all in your head.  This place does exist, but you are not really here.  You are...elsewhere.&quot;

Her words fill your head and you try to wrap your brain around them, but all you can think about is how beautifully melodic her voice is.  Angelic.

&quot;It&#39;s like a dream or...or a story...do you understand?  No.  Of course not.  Let me start at the beginning.&quot;

She takes another sip of wine and a tiny bead of it beads on her perfect crimson lips.  You can&#39;t tear your eyes away from it.

&quot;A few years ago, I started a small company with one basic purpose:  To trap men.  Men have been running the economy and for that matter...the world, for far too long and it is time to change that.&quot;

&quot;Now trapping men is easy.  They think with their dicks.  A girl with a smart mind and a sexy body has no trouble outwitting most of the male species.  Believe me.  I know.&quot;

She laughs, and the sound causes your body to tingle with pleasure.

&quot;The alpha males are so genetically accustomed to thinking with their cock that they pose no trouble.  The ones that are a danger, are the ones that can control that base instinct.  The non-alpha males.  The one&#39;s who KNOW, deep down in their hearts that they are lesser men.  The ones that have to overcompensate for their genetic short-comings by being successful at business.  It is men like these...like you, &lt;&lt;print $name_first&gt;&gt;, who are difficult to trap.&quot;

She taps the pencil on her notepad as she talks.  Your eyes fall to it and watch mesmerized as it goes up and down.

&quot;So the most obvious solution was to put you and your kind into jobs that you will never be able to escape.  Jobs that keep you at a pleasantly subservient level.  I think you see where I&#39;m going here, right?&quot;

She looks at you as if expecting an answer.  You try to think of one.  But your mind is empty.  Blank.  You look at her helplessly.

&quot;Oh, right.  Of course.&quot; She scribbles another sentence on the notepad and while she is writing, you suddenly discover the exact response.

&quot;Yes, Miss Daniels,&quot; you say.  There is a pleasant euphoria in knowing the exact, perfect response to a situation.  For the first time today, there is no doubt in your mind.  You feel perfectly at ease.

&quot;So in an effort to achieve this goal, this job placement of the non-alpha males...I have developed a computer program...a game, if you will.

She stands up and walks slowly around the room, pacing as she talks.  She is excited about this.  Energy seems to crackle around her and as she gets to the window another bolt of lightning lights up the room.

&quot;This game is disguised as a story.  A harmless little fantasy about a guy trapped in a company that makes him dress like a girl.  It&#39;s nothing revolutionary, at least not in the writing, but there is something different about it.&quot;

&quot;You see, this story let&#39;s the reader make choices as to which way they want the story to go.  It&#39;s a branching story, with every option giving a different response.  But here&#39;s the clever bit.  Each choice has a subliminal message in it.  Every time the reader clicks a choice, they get a little, hidden message that their brain picks up and stores.&quot;

&quot;These guys that read the story, think that it&#39;s only a fantasy.  A cute, little diversion.  But what they don&#39;t know is that every time they read it, they become more and more like what the story is about.  They are actually subliminally trained to BE little, air-headed secretaries.  It&#39;s really quite brilliant.&quot;

She moves behind you and her hands rest on your shoulders.  You can feel the heat of them through your thin blouse and your trapped member, throbs painfully against your belt.  You shiver with ecstasy, knowing that should her skin touch yours you will explode with orgasm.

Her lips move down next to your ear.

&quot;So now you know,&quot; she whispers, her words causing every hair left on your body to stand to attention, &quot;Now you know what this is and where you are.  By getting here, by breaking out of the...game...you have proven that you might be too much of an alpha male for this program.&quot;

You squirm as your cock throbs against the unyielding belt, your smooth thighs doing nothing to quench the arousal as they rub against each other. Then her hands leave your shoulders and the intense sexual tidal wave is slightly diminished.

She walks back around in front of you and you can&#39;t take your eyes away.  Her body is perfection, her face divine.

&quot;It is time for you to go,&quot; she says.  Her fingers drift down to the belt which holds the pink robe cinched to her waist, &quot;Back out the door and back to your training, &lt;&lt;print $name_first&gt;&gt;.&quot;  The knot at her waist slowly eases apart. &quot;Miss Payne will take you back down to your desk and you will write an apology to Miss Worthington for being such a disobedient girl.&quot;  The robe falls open slightly.  She wears nothing underneath, but the shadows of the room keep her bare flesh in mystery.

&quot;Lissa, come to bed.&quot;  The voice comes from the other room.  Playful and sexy as hell.  You feel a wash of sexual energy fill the room and your eyes drift up to meet the woman&#39;s.  They sparkle and you hear the robe drop to the floor.  You try to lower your eyes, to view this Goddess in all of her naked splendor, but you can&#39;t move.  Your eyes are trapped on hers.

&quot;You are no alpha-male,&quot; she says, her voice steady and certain, &quot;You will try not to read the story, to play the game.  But you will.  You will read it over and over, knowing that each time you do you become more and more of an airheaded girl.  And soon...you won&#39;t even care.&quot;

Your eyes close in a blink and you feel a sudden wash of vertigo wash over you.

You are no longer sitting.  You&#39;re back in the elevator, hurtling downward.  The bell dings, the door opens and as if in a dream you walk slowly down the hall, weaving and winding mindlessly through the corridors.  You watch your hand find the doorknob, not even questioning if it&#39;s the right door.  You enter the small reception room and sit immediately at the desk.  The computer is already turned on, with a word processing program loaded.  Your fingers find the keys.

You shiver as a chill runs through your body, your panties catching another squirt of liquid.

Then suddenly the words stop, your fingers pull back from the keyboard and you find yourself staring at the screen.

Dear Miss Worthington.  I am sorry for the trouble I have caused.  I am just an air-headed slut and I didn&#39;t know any better.  I will do anything for your forgiveness.  Please forgive me and I will be the best secretary you have ever had.

Your mind goes back and you realize you can&#39;t quite remember what you&#39;re apologizing for.  You must have done something really bad though.  Hopefully, Miss Worthington will forgive you for it.  You press the print button, sending it to the printer in the inner office.  You feel better already.  You mince over to the doorway, straightening your skirt as you go.

You put a hand on the doorknob and are beginning to turn it before you realize that you are acting more and more like a girl.  Something in your brain sets off an alarm, but you can&#39;t quite put your finger on what it is.  Nevertheless, you take a deep breath and remind yourself that you are not a girl and that soon this horrible day will be over.  You step into the office.

Your apology.

I&#39;m a guy!  What the fuck did you...&quot;

The words are knocked out of you as she throws you against the wall.  Her body presses hard against you, grinding against you as you struggle to get away.

Then her lips find yours, her tongue invading into your mouth.  Between your legs, your cock throbs and spits, aching for release.  All thoughts of anger are gone.  All you want, more than anything, is to keep kissing this woman.

You didn&#39;t realize until this very second, how incredibly horny you were.  Everything in this place seems to emphasize it.  The outfit, your boss, even the incredibly demeaning way they&#39;re treating you.  You feel ready to burst.  

Her lips break away from yours, finding their way around to your ear.  She grinds against you harder, her breath tickling your neck.

Her hand winds down between your legs, lifting your skirt and rubbing belt through your panties.

&quot;Of course you could always go to a locksmith and have a big, burly guy between your legs for an hour or two.  I know I wouldn&#39;t mind that...&quot;

You moan.  You&#39;ve got to get out of this chastity belt.  You just can&#39;t take it anymore.

You feel a cold chill on your neck and you look up startled, only to see her drop the chain the rest of the way over your head.  Your eyes follow the cord that connects the chain to the strap in her hand.  You whimper even before she pulls the chain tight.  The metal digs into your neck and she pulls you forward.  You can&#39;t even resist.  The thing has stopped the flow of air and you scramble forward as she drags you back over to her desk.

&quot;Good girl,&quot; she says as she stops.  The chain gets just enough slack in it to give you some air and you gasp it in.  The bitch has collared you.  She&#39;s put you on a fucking leash.

You bring your hands up trying to get the thing off your neck...off your head, but she jerks the leash and the things cinches shut again cutting off your air.  You drop your hands, begging with your eyes for her to stop.  She gives you a little slack and you collapse onto all fours again, gasping and wheezing.

&quot;Do not touch your collar, bitch,&quot; she says, kicking you lightly with her foot, &quot;It&#39;ll be a lot harder for you to crawl around if I have to tie your hands.&quot;

&quot;...please...&quot; you whimper.  That&#39;s all you can get out before you have to gasp for breath again.

&quot;You WANT me to tie your hands?  What a little slut you are!  Maybe if you&#39;re a good girl, I&#39;ll tie you up later.&quot;

She chuckles and pulls you around to the front of the desk.  You scramble on all fours to keep up.  If she gets too far ahead of you, the collar cinches shut and you choke.  You have to stay perfectly at her side.  Heeling.  Just like an obedient dog.

&quot;Look up here, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;, she says tugging your chain lightly to point your head at the desk, &quot;Since you&#39;ve been a good girl, and begged forgiveness, you&#39;ll get the present I bought for you.&quot;  She indicates the packages on top of the table.  She picks each one up and places them in a line in front of you on the floor.  There are three.  A large one, a medium one and a small one.  The boxes are all non-descript brown and they are all shut with no indication of what is inside of them.

&quot;Now you only get one of these,&quot; she says in a teasing tone, &quot;You haven&#39;t been THAT good of a girl, after all.  So which one do you want, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;?&quot;

They are clear, sacks of gel.  In fact, they look sort of like...

You look up at Miss Worthington horrified.

&quot;Congratulations, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;. Those are your new breasts.  We&#39;ll get them put in tomorrow.&quot;

You hear a moan of horror and realize it came from you.  At least you think it was horror.  The thing between your legs seems to like the mental picture that has popped into your head.  Breasts.  On your chest.  IN your chest.  They can&#39;t do this.  They just can&#39;t.  You drop them horrified and they splut onto the floor.

&quot;Now, now,&quot; she says chuckling, &quot;Put them back in the box.  That&#39;s no way to treat a gift.&quot;  She jerks the chain and with your air supply gone, you quickly try to gather up the blobs and stuff them back in the box.

&quot;Good girl,&quot; she says soothingly, &quot;Those should be nice, firm B-cups.  Not large, but definately perky.  They&#39;re going to look wonderful on you.  Now why don&#39;t you come over here and thank me for you present.&quot;

What felt so strange and scary six hours earlier, now feels safe and welcoming.  You hurry as fast as the heels allow toward the break room. The lockers; the place to get out of these ridiculous clothes.  Then you can go home and never come back.  Not to mention getting out of the HORRIBLE belt. 

You feel disgusting.  Your own juice is dripping down your legs, your panties are doing NOTHING to contain it anymore.  Your mouth tastes of... 

You shudder at the thought of what this place has made you do...against your will...helpless to stop it... Will you ever feel clean again?

Miss Payne opens the door.  Becky scurries inside and you&#39;re hot on her heels, eager for the final stage of the day.  What you see stops you in your tracks.  All around you, beautiful women are peeling out of uniforms just like yours...Some are bare breasted, others are down to just their corsets and stockings.  Each one a Playboy Centerfold in the flesh.

You start to shake even as Becky peels off her blouse and bra and bounces over to her locker. 

You&#39;re supposed to undress in front of these girls!

They&#39;re all going to find out you&#39;re a guy!  They&#39;re going to know the horrible, slutty things you&#39;ve done all day...and they&#39;re going to think you WANTED to do them.  Your legs start to give way...

You feel Miss Payne&#39;s hand on your back, her lips near your ears.

&quot;Strip down, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.&quot;  Her hand squeezes your neck and then propels you forward; towards the locker with your &#39;name&#39; on it.  Your hand trembles as you open it, your eyes dart back and forth to the eye-candy on either side of you.  The blond to your left gives you a smile to die for and your panties fail to contain a squirt so big you imagine that you can hear it.  Your eyes drift down to the bra the girl wears, and the two massive globes it holds.  For a fraction of a second you feel inadequate...envious...jealous...and then you shake yourself out of it.  You&#39;ve got to get out of here.  Back into your male clothing before the lunatics here actually GIVE you breasts like that...

You open the locker and peer inside.  The blood drains from your face.

Your regular clothes aren&#39;t there.  Just two plastic packages that seem to have clean versions of the uniform you&#39;re wearing now and three frilly, satiny things, identical except for color.  You reach out and touch first the pink one, then the red one and then the black one.  The material is so sensual that you shudder.  You can&#39;t imagine actually wearing it...

The thought lasts for just a second...the image of sliding it over your now smooth skin and feeling the material makes your body dance...then the thought disappears and reality sets in. 

How the hell are you supposed to get home without your clothes?  Worse, do they actually expect you to change into this flimsy little nightie thing?  You look around and see all the other girls are slipping into them...and then lining up at the door.  What the hell is going on here?  Will this nightmare never end!  You glare at Miss Payne and she meets your glare.  With only her eyes she asks you the question:  Will you change into your nightie like a good girl, or create a scene?!?

It feels like every eye in the room is on you...and you&#39;re not far from wrong.  The girls who have already changed, watch you with eagerness...and annoyance.  Wherever you&#39;re being taken next, some of them are eager to go.

By the time you have your skirt off, you&#39;re one of three girls still changing...the other two dozen wait...and WATCH...

Then it dawns on you...you can&#39;t get your shoes off.  The horrible things are locked on...And the corset you&#39;re in...the one pushing up your chest into your tiny breasts...if you take that off...then they&#39;ll all know!

You glance at the two girls still changing...one of them is nude except for her lacy pink panties, stockings and shoes...also locked on you notice.  That solves that question at least...you glance at the skinny brunette to your right...She is slipping the satin nightie over the top of the corset.  

Part of you is relieved.  You won&#39;t have to reveal your true nature to the rest of these girls...

Then a different realization sinks in:  You have to keep wearing this stupid corset thing for an undetermined amount of time...

The two girls who were still dressing slip into line.  All eyes are on you now.  You see Becky, her eyes wide with irritation.  Her lips soundlessly word:  &#39;Hurry up&#39;.

Wincing you reach into your locker and pull out a nightie...

You want it to come out forceful and assertive; instead it squeaks out of you like a sigh. It takes a real effort to force yourself to look up at Miss Payne.  You try to make your stare angry and firm.  Your eyes betray you and all that comes out is pleading.

The other girls have finished changing and have lined up.  Only one or two are still finishing and they are almost done too.  All eyes are on you.  They burn into you with curiosity, boredom, impatience...even anger.  You&#39;re not only aggravating Miss Payne, you&#39;re making the girls upset too.

The horrible woman at the door growls softly.

&quot;Get her changed girls.&quot;

Your eyes widen as half a dozen of these beautiful pinups descend on you.  Your eyes meet Miss Payne&#39;s for one fleeting second before you are completely surrounded.  That horrible smirk on her face is the last clear image you have.

Your blouse is ripped open and you hear the buttons pop off.  Your skirt actually rips off, the thin fabric making a loud tearing sound in the room.  The one holding your arms giggles.  &quot;Look how wet she is.  I think the new girl likes it here.&quot;  Your whimpers and protests are completely ignored as you suddenly feel three different slinky outfits tossed onto your bare skin.  

&quot;Pick one,&quot; a voice says in your ear.  You turn to look and see that it&#39;s Becky.  She&#39;s helping these bitches torture you.  What a b...

Your thoughts are cut short as fingers dig into your ribs.  The girls have started tickling you.  You flail wildly, trying to get away from the fingers that tickle your sides, your thighs, your knees, your feet.  Tears flood from your eyes, even as all the silky smooth flesh wrapped around you causes your crotch to spurt over and over.  You flail out blindly grabbing the outfits and you hear a giggling, tortured voice screaming and begging to wear a nightie.  Suddenly the onslaught ceases and you fight your way to your knees, trying to catch your breath.  You hold the nighties clutched to your cinched chest, the rest of the girls circle you like prey waiting to pounce again should you show any resistance.  Your eyes meet Miss Payne and the horrible woman smirks at you.

&quot;That uniform will come out of your salary slut,&quot;  Miss Payne chuckles, &quot;Costs more than your lazy ass even made today.  Now shall we cut up those other outfits too and make you stay in what little you have on?  Or are you going to be a good, little girl?&quot;

You glance warily at the girls all around you and then look down at  the outfits in your hands.  Like seemingly everything else today, you don&#39;t seem to have a choice...


[[Choose the pink nightie.|c5_inline][$nightie = &#39;pink&#39;]]

The material drifting down over your sensitive skin makes you squirm.  It feels so slinky against your arms and back and tickles your thighs as it hits them for the first time.  

You hurry into the line, eager to get all the eyes off of you.  You can&#39;t help but notice how exposed you are now with each and every step you take.  You try not to think about it, but your eyes find the girl in line in front of you. You can&#39;t help but study the outfit you are all crammed into.  

The outfit falls high on the thigh, barely covering the bottom of the girl&#39;s backside and not coming close to covering the stockings or garter straps.  It hugs all of her curves, which are VERY noticeable.  The back is cut low, the straps narrow to emphasize the girl&#39;s shoulder blades.  And the front...

The front dips down low enough to show the cleavage of a Hooters Girl.

The thing in your belt betrays you again and you wince...then you remember that you&#39;re dressed exactly like this girl...you feel the outfit hug YOUR curves...show off YOUR body...and you squirt again!  Every tiny move you make, causes your body to betray you making you more and more horny.  You hear a mewling whimper coming from your own throat.  You&#39;d do anything to be let out of the belt and that realization frightens you even more.


[[Click here to continue.|c5_apartments]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="276" name="c5_apartments" tags="" position="725,3475">The elevator zooms downward.  You have absolutely no idea what to expect.  Your mind is barely even working at this point.  The sexual tension coursing through your body makes thinking an impossibility.  Not only are the clothes you&#39;ve been crammed into stimulating your poor trapped crotch, but you are standing shoulder to shoulder with two dozen girls dressed like lingerie models.  You can feel the heat coming off of them, every move causing skin and satin to caress you. 

The elevator doors open.  You don&#39;t know what floor you&#39;ve landed on, but it&#39;s below the lobby.  The car is too crammed full of buxom distractions for you to get a good glimpse of the control panel either.  You do know one thing.  You&#39;re below ground now.

You feel like a cow in the center of a herd as you are ushered out of the elevator and down yet another hallway.  This one is not nearly as nice as the ones that were upstairs.  There are no paintings, mirrors or decorations on the walls.  They are stark, and no-nonsense.

As the group of you are ushered down the hallway, the clump straightens itself into a line.  All of you marching behind Queen Lemming Payne.  You watch the girls ahead of you, trying not to focus on how much the stupid skimpy outfit you&#39;re wearing is causing the thing in your belt to ache.  The other girls are silent.  There&#39;s no giggling, talking or even a whisper.  It is almost eerie.  The only sound is the heels clicking in near-unison on the hard floor as the group of you march to whatever degrading hell is next.

Your eyes drop to the backside of the girl in front of you.  The heart-shaped globes shifting in the tight satiny material only inches from you causes another squirt down below and liquid oozes down your legs.  Your panties have hit maximum saturation point.  They will hold no more.  You wince as the liquid creeps downward, hitting the top of your left stocking.

The strange procession of flesh continues to the end of the hallway, where the whole group of you are loaded onto another elevator...this one isn&#39;t nearly as nice as the previous one.  As you&#39;re crammed in, you maneuver yourself towards the front so you can see the control panel.  The first obvious thing you notice is that this elevator car is also key-card activated.  The second thing you notice is that you&#39;re currently on the top floor, despite that you are already below ground...and there are a LOT of buttons on this thing, labeled with the alphabet instead of numbers.  You watch with both fear and curiosity as the letters progress, the downward motion of the car symbolic of the way your day has gone.  

The car stops moving at letter J.  You count it off in your head. . . J is 10 floors, you&#39;re at LEAST 10 floors below ground!  

The doors open to reveal yet another hallway which opens up into a series of bunkbeds.  At least 10 or 15 on each side.   At the very end, the barracks opens up into a small alcove with a few tables and chairs.  The walls are a pink color, stark and undecorated save for a single word painted in flowery cursive right by the elevator door:  Jiggles.

&quot;Jiggles&#39; out!&quot; Payne barks. 

&quot;Good luck.  Keep your head down and try not to get involved with anything,&quot;  The voice is soft next to your ear.  You turn your head to see Nikki leaving moving slowly forward as girls file out of the car.  It seems like such a long time ago that you were lusting after her in the lobby.

&quot;What&#39;s a Jiggle?&quot; you whisper back.

&quot;My last name silly,  Nikki Jiggles.  Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll get one soon.&quot;  Then she is beyond whispering distance and is moving out the door, leaving you with no one but Miss Payne and a handful of scantily clad strangers.

Even as the elevator starts down again, you can&#39;t get over it.  They&#39;ve renamed these poor girls with sexual names.  They&#39;re going to rename YOU!  You&#39;re going to be assigned a last name.  A horrible, sexually teasing last name!

Your name is now &lt;&lt;print $name_girl_combined&gt;&gt;. You&#39;ve lost your identity completely and been given this horrible new one.     

You stagger slightly down the hallway, your legs shaking from this new situation almost as much as having to walk in the heels.  Why should being given yet another embarrassing name affect you so deeply?

Your heart is beating hard in your chest and you&#39;re having trouble breathing.  You&#39;re trapped.  Trapped in this sexually, submissive hell.  You have no way of getting back to the ground level and even if you did, all of your identification is gone.  All that is left is &lt;&lt;print $name_girl_combined&gt;&gt;.  You&#39;re having trouble getting your breathing under control as the true panic sets in.  You blink back tears, wanting to scream for help, wanting to beg everyone and anyone for release... not just from the horrid place itself but from the sexual torment that is still oozing down your leg.  If you don&#39;t cum soon... 

You take a tentative step and then another.   The hall opens up into a giant room with two-level bunks on either side.  Bed eight is on the bottom right in the middle of the room.  At the end of the row of beds is a small gathering area where a handful of other girls have gathered together, giggling and talking together.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="281" name="c5_findbed" tags="" position="100,3600">You sit down on the bed, eager to get off your feet.  They ache all the way up into your calf muscles.  Tears start to form in your eyes as you try and pull the horrible shoes off, but the lock keeps them fastened tightly in place.  Your breath catches in your chest and your fingers find their way down to the belt between your legs, trying to pry at the edges, trying to get it OFF!!!  It doesn&#39;t move an inch.  Inside it, your trapped member throbs painfully, so tiny and trapped, stimulated but unable to do anything about it.  You claw at it, so desperate to cum. You need relief from this CONSTANT stimulation.  You pull at the belt harder, laying back on the bed, trying to get out of these terrible bonds.  Lying down makes it worse.  You feel the slinky  &lt;&lt;print $nightie&gt;&gt; outfit you&#39;re in caressing your body.  Your fingers are sticky now from being between your legs and you realize for the first time just how wet you really are.  You&#39;ve got to get out of this place... you&#39;ve just got to. . .

&quot;I have a BED-MATE!!!&quot;

The voice comes from the foot of your bed and your head swivles around, your face blushing with embarrassment.  You can&#39;t help but notice how you look. . . your hands trapped between your thighs, rolling around on the bed. . .&quot;Ooooh and look how cute you are!&quot;

The girl is beautiful . . and even that word does no justice to her.  Much like every other girl here, including yourself, the girl is sex incarnate.  A buxom blond with a face that could cause a war.

&quot;I&#39;m Jasmine.  And you must be &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  I was wondering when they&#39;d find someone for that locker.&quot;  She suddenly seems to notice the awkward position you&#39;ve frozen in.  

&quot;Trying to get out of your belt, aren&#39;t you?&quot;  She giggles and jumps on the bed next to you... her nightie flies up as she lands, her bare leg touching yours and sending shivers up your whole body.  She doesn&#39;t seen to have a clue that you&#39;re not just as female as she is.  &quot;It won&#39;t come off.  Margarite tried to pick hers and couldn&#39;t... and she used to steal cars!&quot;  

You look at her helplessly, your eyes about to overflow with tears.   You are SO horny, your feet are still trapped in these ridiculous shoes and stockings and your whole body aches for release.  You feel tied up, except instead of ropes or cords you&#39;re wrapped in lingerie.  This whole scenario is just ridiculous.  They can&#39;t really keep you prisoner here, can they?  You look up at your new &#39;room-mate&#39;, a million questions racing through your mind.

The girl just giggles at you, her hand landing on your bare thigh above the infuriating stocking.

&quot;I ask myself that everyday.  They remove it once a week for cleaning, but it&#39;s not a pleasant process.  My boss did let me out of the belt one time...&quot;

Her voice turns winsome and distant, a faint smile appearing on the corner of her lips.

&quot;In any case, don&#39;t expect to be out anytime soon, special forms have to be filled out and they make you go in front of the board and ask permission.  It&#39;s terrible...and don&#39;t expect to get used to wearing it either.  I&#39;ve been here two years and I still feel like I&#39;m about to explode.&quot;

You look at her in horror.  Two years.  TWO YEARS of being locked into perpetual horniness...acting like a bitch in heat... is she insane!?!  The only thing that makes any sense is that the silly slut LIKES being tortured like this.  You&#39;ve heard about fetishes like that... but how could anyone...&lt;&lt;include c5_introduction_txt&gt;&gt;

&quot;It&#39;s going to be so much fun sharing a bed with you.  I can tell.&quot; She squeezes your leg playfully making you squirm in an erotic and ticklish way.  &quot;But we need to make sure the ground rules are established.  I&#39;ve waited a long time to be a Top Girl and we just need to be on the same page with how this relationship is going to work.&quot;

She giggles at you, her wonderful breasts jiggling from her laughter.

&quot;You can&#39;t get out of here sweetie.  You have to be a Manager to get the elevator to work and there&#39;s no other way back up to the office.  A few girls have tried, but they all failed...and then Management took them away.  You need to be careful, sweetie.  There are worse things to be than an office girl.  Especially around here.&quot;

You whimper as she puts her hand on yours, her soft warm skin causing an ache in your trapped crotch.  No escape.  No way out.  You&#39;re stuck here. &lt;&lt;include c5_introduction_txt&gt;&gt;

She giggles and lets her hand fall on your calf, rubbing your leg playfully through the stocking.

&quot;Well let&#39;s see...There&#39;s probably about fifty girls at any time.  It&#39;s so hard to say because they come and go.  I&#39;m one of the oldest here now.  I&#39;ve been here almost two years and I&#39;ll be auctioned off soon.&quot;

Her hand on your leg had your full focus, but on the word auction you snap back to attention, looking into her beautiful blue eyes. 

&quot;Auction?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, once we get past a certain age and proficiency level they like to sell us off to clients.  It keeps their offices all young and perky and we all sell for quite a lot...especially after we&#39;re trained.&quot;

This is INSANE!  How can this place even exist.  You&#39;re going to be SOLD?  Then it sinks in... two years!  This girl has been here two years and she almost sounds eager to get sold off.  What kind of madhouse are you trapped in? &lt;&lt;include c5_introduction_txt&gt;&gt;

&quot;Now?&quot; she giggles and sidles up to you, snuggling in close to you on the bed.  Your crotch aches and leaks and then aches and leaks some more as the slinky material coating her body, caresses the material wrapped around yours. &quot;Now we get ready for bed.  I&#39;m so excited to have a bed-mate. &quot; 

In the erotic fog that surrounds you, her words cause the hairs on your neck to stand up.  Bedmate?  She can&#39;t possibly mean... &lt;&lt;include c5_introduction_txt&gt;&gt;

Now Margarite, she likes to call her bedmate her Bitch.&quot; She giggles as if the word is vulgar. &quot;But I think that&#39;s awfully crass, don&#39;t you?  I&#39;d much rather think of you as my girlfriend.  And as long as you&#39;re a good girlfriend, I won&#39;t have to punish you.&quot;

She smacks the top of your still-aching backside playfully.  This has to be a joke.  You&#39;re expected to be subservient to this buxom airhead?

She smiles at you, still sweetly, but there is a hint of something else there too.  Something less nice.  She kicks her feet up onto the bed, her heels sticking out over the edge.

&quot;Now be a good girl and kiss my shoe...&quot; She giggles again. &quot;...until I tell you to stop.&quot;


[[Refuse!|c5_refuseshoe]]
[[Kiss her shoes.|c5_kissshoes]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="288" name="c5_refuseshoe" tags="" position="975,3600">&quot;Fuck you!&quot; the words don&#39;t come out as harsh as you&#39;d like.  A day of forced submission has made even simple acts of defiance difficult.  You do know one thing.  You need to be strong here.  If this craziness is true, you&#39;re going to be sharing a room with this woman for a while...and like any other &#39;prison&#39; you need to establish that she is not your superior.  You only have one chance, this first chance to establish the relationship.  You meet her eyes and the look in them sends a wave of uneasiness through you.  In her eyes you see the same exact thought:  Establish Dominance.

&quot;I just KNEW you were going to be that way...I knew it.  You think you&#39;re better than me, don&#39;t you?  You think you can just come in here and boss me around like Lynda does?  Well never again, you little slut!  I&#39;ve worked hard to get where I am...&quot;

You scream in surprise as she leaps on top of you, her hands grabbing your wrists and forcing them down to your sides.  Your breath is knocked from you, as her body lands on top of yours, pushing you flat on the bed.  You try to fight, try to get away, but her knees land on your arms and you find yourself pinned by her buxom frame.  Her hands slide into your hair, grabbing it tight... holding your head straight up, staring into her burning eyes.

&quot;Now you listen to me, bitch.  You&#39;re new here and there are so many rules that a new girl could accidentally break.  I can help you with that... OR...&quot;

She leans up just enough to let one of her hands slide behind her to your legs.  With one of her long nails she snags the stocking on your left leg and you cringe as you hear the ripping sound.  She pulls at it slowly, dragging it out until you can feel the big, torn section from knee to thigh.

&quot;...or I can make your life a living hell for every waking second.  The choice is up to you...&quot;

With a scary suddenness, she slams her mouth down on yours and sucks your lower lip into her mouth hungrily.  Her crotch is grinding against you, riding you.  Even the slutty office girls are using you as their own personal toy.  Tears have filled your eyes now, tears of frustration and helplessness.  You squirm underneath her, but it only serves to stimulate her more...and to stimulate yourself too.  Your crotch is in agony, eager to swell, to grow, to cum... but it can&#39;t... and it won&#39;t.  It will only leak and throb and want until someone in charge of you takes pity and lets you out.

&quot;...please...&quot; the voice is soft, girlish and submissive.  It scares you more than anything that it comes out of your own throat.

Your plea is cut short by the sound of girls cheering and laughing.  Your little catfight has drawn the attention of every girl on the floor.


[[Click here to continue.|c5_girlscheer]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="289" name="c5_kissshoes" tags="" position="1100,3600">A wave of embarrassment washes over you as you sink to your knees beside the bed.  Not only have you allowed yourself to be turned into a sextoy by this horrible company, but you&#39;re not even man enough to stand up against this girl who&#39;s in the same exact position as you.  Her foot is right in front of you, the sexy arch of her foot locked into a heel that is identical to yours except for it&#39;s height.  Her shoes are at least two inches higher than yours and you shudder at the thought of wearing similar ones.  Your legs ache enough from the lower ones.

Yet as your lips touch her shoe and you hear the girlish giggle above you, you know that you&#39;ll be wearing the same shoes eventually.  This place has you trapped.  You have no choice but to do whatever they ask of you...whatever anyone asks of you.

&quot;Lick it clean please, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  And then the other one too.&quot;  Jasmine says.  You look up at her with only your eyes, as your tongue darts out to begin cleaning her shoes.  The taste is horrible and it just reinforces that this is what you are now.  A toy to be used by anyone that wants you.  A sexy slut, wrapped in the most revealing and degrading outfits.  You&#39;ll be used and treated as what you look like.  You feel like crying, but there is a worrying thought that drifts through your head as you start in on her second foot.  While you&#39;re embarrassed and horrified at what this place has turned you into in a single day, there is also a small glimmer of contentment.  No more doubt.  No more uncertainty.  You do what you&#39;re told, when you&#39;re told.  That&#39;s your new life... and while it&#39;s scary to contemplate, there is an undeniable appeal to it as well.

 It&#39;s the footsteps behind you that cause you to  stop in mid-lick, frozen in the act.  The chuckle causes your cheeks to blush.

The chant starts softly and then builds louder and louder.  You whimper underneath the girl.  They&#39;re all laughing at you.  Laughing and cheering for the girl who has you pinned to the bed.  No one&#39;s going to help you.

&quot;Break her in Jazz!&quot;

You can&#39;t see who said it, not with Jasmine on top of you, but it doesn&#39;t matter.  What does matter is the scary look of doubt that suddenly appears in Jasmine&#39;s eyes.  You&#39;re staring into them and the fear that has crept inside of them at the attention you two are receiving makes you feel scared as well.  

&quot;I... I...&quot; Jasmine&#39;s faltering lets you worm backwards out from under her.  Your back hits the wall, her knees still stradling your legs.  Your eyes never leave hers.  You can&#39;t look away.  The girl is terrified and is feeding off the fear coming out of your eyes.

The chant has changed, the girls clapping their hands with it...giggling and laughing and pointing...

&quot;Break her in! Break her in! Break her in!&quot;

As if in slow motion an object drops beside your legs, thrown by one of the girls that have encircled the bed.  In unison, you and Jasmine look at the object and then back at each other, eyes wide.  A thousand words pass between the two of you, unspoken but clear as crystal from just the look.  She&#39;s scared of the object.  So are you.  The long fleshy cock with the straps on it might as well be a snake for how you both shuddered at the sight of it.  They want her to use it.  To use it on YOU.  And she&#39;s scared.  Scared because everyone is watching.  If she does it, they&#39;ll make fun and laugh and point.  If she doesn&#39;t... you don&#39;t know what will happen, but she&#39;ll lose something.  Respect, maybe?  Power?  Or maybe someone will use it on her.  You can tell she&#39;s had experience with the thing on the bed and not necessarily the good kind.  No matter what though, she&#39;s scared.  Scared of being the center of attention.  Scared of what she&#39;s going to have to do... to you!

Your head is shaking involuntarily from side to side.  You hear a steady soft mantra coming out of your lips.

&quot;...no...no...no...no...no...no...&quot; 

It&#39;s barely audible, but then you are so frightened, you can barely keep breathing.

&quot;Let&#39;s show the new girl how we do things around here.&quot;  Jasmine&#39;s voice has a mock confidence to it that her eyes lack.  Her eyes are apologizing to you, telling you how sorry she is that it&#39;s playing out this way and yet at the same time leaving no doubt that it IS going to play out this way.  

Not that you&#39;re looking at her eyes anymore.  You&#39;re watching the girl&#39;s hand as it reaches out and grabs hold of the fake phallus.  Like a gunslinger in the old west she straps it around her waist, and then reaches through her legs to pull the center strap through.  She&#39;s moving mechanically, slow and deliberate.  

And you can&#39;t move.  

You&#39;re absolutely terrified.  You&#39;re about to be raped.  Raped in front of all these laughing and giggling girls.

&quot;Turn over, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  On your hands and knees.  You&#39;re going to make me feel like a man again.&quot;  

You&#39;re still chanting your mantra, shaking your head and trying to wake up from this nightmare.  It&#39;s too much for your poor brain to take in.  Hands and knees?  Submit to her?  Make her feel like a man?  Your mind drifts keying on one word she just said, droning out the chanting and the laughing and the pointing.

Again?

She said that you&#39;ll make her feel like a man... again?  Your head still shaking, the tiny &#39;no...no...no&#39; chant coming out of your mouth as you look up at her face.  It can&#39;t be possible.  Jasmine looks like a centerfold.  Her perfect breasts jutting out in the skimpy nightie, her legs toned and slinky in their stockings, her face flawless.  Your eyes drift down to your own smooth legs, wrapped in the same casing, then up to the faceless mass of girls around you.  Men.  They were all men.  Or at least most of them were.  Who could tell for sure?  You&#39;re not the first one they&#39;ve transformed!

Jasmine&#39;s hands on your legs shakes you out of your trance.  She&#39;s trying to flip you over!  Your eyes fall downward to the cock jutting out from her crotch.

&quot;All fours slut!  Time for you to become a woman!&quot;

You&#39;re trembling as you assume the position and she barks out a word that makes the reality of the situation even more real.

&quot;Lube.&quot; 

Lube.  Lubricant.  For a moment there is even a sense of relief.  Only for a moment though as the reality crashes back down.  You don&#39;t look.  You&#39;re too scared to.  But you can sense another girl approach the bed and you hear the squishy sound of gel being spread on the girl&#39;s fake cock.  You shudder again, your whimpering barely audible for everyone under their cheers and only causes more laughter and taunts.

&quot;I told you slut... I will be top girl.  You belong to them during the day, but at night...&quot; Your panties are being pulled down... her fingers digging at the strap of the belt that goes between your cheeks.  You feel the slimy, long thing against your thigh and you start to cry.  &quot;... at night you belong to me.&quot; 

Her cock finds it&#39;s target and begins it&#39;s journey...the crowd cheers.

You don&#39;t try to resist.  You&#39;re not even sure you want to.  As crazy as it might be, there is a tingling in your belly as you think about what you have become.  This sexy girl wants to fuck you.  She thinks she&#39;s better than you are, but she&#39;s wrong.  Because you know how this game works now.  It&#39;s all slowly falls into place in your brain as you assume the position.

&quot;Lube.&quot; 

You sense another girl approaching the bed and you hear the squishy sound of gel being spread on the girl&#39;s fake cock.  You&#39;re happy for the consideration.  But your thoughts are elsewhere.  Your thoughts are on Jasmine.  She thinks she&#39;s better... but she&#39;s not.  She still wants to BE a man and that&#39;s not how the game is played.  This place wants you to be a woman.  No, not even that.  A girl.  A toy.  They want you to be a slut.  And there&#39;s no doubt in your mind what you have to do.  You bite your lower lip as you think about it.  As you really consider it. 

A slut.  A toy.  Could you really dedicate your life to being those things?

Your panties are pulled down.  You let them fall, spreading your legs as Jasmine digs the back of the belt out from between your cheeks.  The girls around you are cheering and laughing, but you notice something else too.  They are all fidgeting with their belts... fingering them, trying to gain pleasure but failing.  Most are flushed with unfulfilled arousal.

Sluts.  We&#39;re all sluts whether we want to be or not.  There&#39;s no choice, except the obvious one.

&quot;Fuck me!&quot; The voice is loud, demanding and utterly unrecognizable.  The voice is yours.

The cheering grows louder, but the laughing has stopped.  It&#39;s been replaced with moans as the girls grind their hands against their trapped crotches. You have more power over them than they can ever have over you.  You can make them want.

You feel the slimy cock travel up your inner thigh and then narrow in on it&#39;s target. You moan.  You&#39;re better than all these girls.  You see that now.  You wanted a job with room for advancement.  You got it.  You&#39;re on the fast track and if you have to climb to that glass ceiling on your back, so be it. 

You feel the girl&#39;s cock find where it&#39;s supposed to go and you arch your back, urging it inward.

&quot;How does it feel, slut?  How does it feel to belong to me?&quot;

You don&#39;t have to answer in words.  Your body tells the whole story.

There are no words for the motion you make other than &#39;freaking out&#39;.  You scream like a crazy person, convulsing off the bed and through the thrall of girls around you.   There&#39;s a collective cheer from the girls along with cries of &#39;Get her!&#39; and &#39;Cock Tease!&#39;.  You fall backwards onto the bed adjacent to yours and your momentum rolls you off the back of it.  You find yourself sprawled on the floor, your nightie up in your arm pits, panties on display to the whole room.

Your mantra has been replaced with another one...

&quot;Must...get...away...must...get...away...&quot;

The thrall of girls are chanting too.  Girls are coming around the side of the bed, over the bed, coming at you and you scramble under the bed... getting further and further away from Number Eight....from your bed...from Jasmine and that horrible, horrible cock.  The cheers and laughter and cruel jibes of the girls makes you think of Lord of the Flies.  This place has turned you into Piggy and they want to make you squeal.  Well fuck them.  The inmates may run the asylum, but you&#39;re not crazy yet!

You feel hands on your legs, pulling you out from your hiding place.  You kick at them and they squeak in surprise.  You claw and drag your way through to the other side of the bed, gain your footing and leap the next one.  You have no idea where you&#39;re going, but AWAY seems like the only possible option.  One bed left and you clambor over it and then you&#39;re there... You&#39;re as far as you can go.  You&#39;re back at the elevator, it&#39;s hard steel doors unyeilding.  You try to work your fingers into the seams but they&#39;re closed tight.  You scream in frustration, tears filling your eyes.  It&#39;s not fair.  It&#39;s just not fair.  You&#39;re trapped here.  Trapped with these crazy she-male bitches.  You sink to your knees, sliding down the unyeilding elevator doors as the girls approach.  They aren&#39;t hurrying.  They know you have no where to go.  You bite your lower lip and close your leaking eyes.  In the darkness of your head say the one word...

&quot;Please.&quot;

The musical ding is timed so perfectly that you think for a moment you imagined it but then you feel the doors of the elevator opening in front of you.  You start breathing again, scrambling forward and away from the crazies...into the safety of the elevator.  You&#39;re going to get out of here.  You&#39;re going to escape.  You&#39;re going to...

&quot;I see you&#39;re making our newest girl feel welcome.&quot;

The voice sends a shiver down your spine.  It&#39;s her.  The one that did this to you.  Payne.

She grabs you by the hair and pulls you up.  You shriek trying to get to your feet before the handful she holds is ripped out.  She half leads and half drags you back into the room and down the aisle to your bunk.  She doesn&#39;t let go so much as toss you.

&quot;It&#39;s time for you girls to be released from your shoes...but judging from this horrible behavior, I don&#39;t think any of you have earned it.&quot; She turns to the rest of the girls and you take one last brief moment of hope.  She&#39;s going to protect you.  She&#39;s not going to let you go, but she&#39;s going to keep them from raping you...

&quot;Obviously this new girl is out of control and a bad influence on all of you.  I trust a night locked in your heels will remind all of you the importance of good behavior and give you all the proper motivation to keep her under control.&quot;

Your mantra is back.  No...no...no...no...

The horrible woman&#39;s eyes catch the bobbing cock strapped to Jasmine&#39;s crotch.  The smile that creeps onto her face makes your tears start anew. 

&quot;Teach her a lesson.  Just make sure she can still walk tomorrow.  She&#39;s got a busy day ahead of her...a lot of busy days.&quot;

She starts for the elevator and you see the girls shifting from foot to foot, as the realization hits them that they&#39;re stuck in their shoes all night.  Their eyes all turn to you even before the elevator doors begin to shut.

&quot;Sleep well, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  Tired girls are more likely to be punished.&quot;  The doors slam shut with a &#39;THOOM&#39;. 

There is a silence that seems to last no more than a second and yet also twenty years.

&quot;Well you&#39;ve fucked us over.&quot; Jasmine growls approaching you on the bed, the cock bobbing up and down as if in agreement with her words. &quot;We can return the favor.  I&#39;ll go first and then the rest of you can teach her a lesson.&quot; 

Fabric is ripped.  Arms pinned.  Legs spread.

Your first day ends with a whimper AND a bang... and then another one... and another one... and another one...


[[Click here to continue.|c5_epilogue]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="294" name="c5_girlchuckle" tags="" position="475,3725">&quot;So I see you have a new toy, Jasmine.  I believe you were told to share...&quot;

Jasmine is suddenly beside you, kneeling next to you.  You&#39;re still turning around to glance at the newcomer.  Her dark skin almost a silhouette with the light shining behind her.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Lynda.  I just got her.  Please...&quot;

Jasmine is trembling.  You can hear the fear in her voice.

&quot;You know the rules, Jaz,&quot; the woman&#39;s voice is stoic and cold.  You blink up at her.  She is dressed the same as both of you.  The little locks dangle off her heels as well.  Yet she seems to be in complete control of Jasmine.  You look back and forth between them.  There is obviously a distinct power balance here.  You submitted to Jasmine, yet Jasmine defers to Lynda.  Your thought is cut short as your eye catches a flutter of her robe.  Something moved.

Your eyes widen, and your breath catches.  Bursting from the front of the skimpy robe of this busty, dark-skinned goddess is a very big...

&quot;You&#39;re a...&quot; You can&#39;t find the word for a moment, &quot;You&#39;re a guy!&quot;

Lynda just laughs, her voice going deep and throaty.  It seems odd coming out of the centerfold body...almost as odd as the protrusion that seems to be growing by the second.

&quot;Stupid bitch.  We&#39;re all guys here.  Or haven&#39;t you figured that out yet?&quot;

She steps closer and you flinch away from the thing pointing at Jasmine.  Jasmine whimpers and looks up at Lynda, her eyes begging.

&quot;Get me ready Jaz.  After I break in the new slut, then she&#39;s all yours.

Jazmine doesn&#39;t hesitate.  Her mouth latches onto the extended organ and inhales it.  You can&#39;t take your eyes away as she milks it, urging it to get bigger, sucking her cheeks in as the thing engorges into her mouth.  The erotic display has caused your mind to short-circuit, your trapped organ tingles even as a phrase floats over in over your head as if it were trapped in a thought balloon above your head.

They&#39;re all men?

You look at Jasmine&#39;s face, flushed with exertion as she coaxes and teases the thing in her mouth.  Her face... 

She&#39;s a guy.  Jasmine too.  Your eyes dart around the room, even as a few other onlookers crowd close to watch Jasmine&#39;s effort on Lynda.  They&#39;re all guys.  They&#39;re all trapped like you...

&quot;Enough Jaz.  Save some for your new friend...

Your mouth drops open in horror.  For you?  She can&#39;t expect you to...

You squeal in surprise as Jasmine descends on you, heaving you up onto the bed, bent over it.  She&#39;s on your back and no matter how you struggle you can&#39;t seem to get enough leverage to get her off.  You scream.

&quot;Please... get off...&quot;

Jasmine&#39;s voice is in your ear, soft, sensual and not at all comforting.

&quot;It&#39;ll be over quick love.  She mounts all the new girls to show her dominance.  They let her keep her belt off at night to keep the rest of us in control and give us experience... but she can&#39;t maintain it.  The hormones make it difficult for her to do much.  Just lay still, it&#39;ll be over soon...

This can&#39;t be happening.  You close your eyes.  Even in the dark, you feel the soft caress of your outfit, the heavy softness of Jasmine on your back.  The soft, nailed hands grab your hips.  You whimper and try to scream again.  Nothing comes out.  There&#39;s no escape.  There&#39;s no where to go.  There&#39;s no one to help you.

You feel the hard thing behind you on your thigh, searching... questing for an opening.  Hands on your panties, yanking downward.  A clarity fills your mind.  There is no escape now.  You&#39;re a prisoner.  A helpless sex-toy that can be used by anyone and everyone...even the other toys.  You bite your lip as the violator slides upwards.  You try to brace yourself.  It doesn&#39;t work.

&quot;It will all be over soon, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.&quot;

You know that Jasmine is lying, however.  It isn&#39;t anywhere near over.  Your new life is just beginning.  As Lynda slides into you, you whimper...and with that single moment, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl + &quot; &quot; + $girl_last&gt;&gt; becomes a final reality.


[[Click here to continue.|c5_epilogue]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="296" name="c5_lynda_sub" tags="" position="725,3725">&quot;Be a good girl and bend over the bed, girl.&quot;

You look up at Lynda with big, wet eyes.  Her cock bobs in your vision, wet with Jasmine&#39;s effort.  Your eyes cut to Jasmine who mouths two words:  &quot;Do it.&quot;

You nibble on your lower lip, even as you find yourself turning around, sliding your upper body onto your bed.  Your whole body feels sensual, the robe causing every movement to feel slinky and erotic.  Your tiny, trapped member throbs painfully and leaks and leaks.

You feel hands on your hips, snagging your panties and sliding them down.  They tickle your smooth legs as they go and you shiver at how exposed you feel.  You see other girls crowding around the bed to watch.  To watch as Lynda mounts you...takes you like a girl.  All of them clutch and grab at their belts.  You clutch at your own, even as you feel Lynda&#39;s hands on your bare hips.

&quot;...please...&quot; your voice is soft, feminine and desperate, &quot;...please get this belt off...&quot;

&quot;Horny slut!&quot; Lynda laughs, smacking your bare ass playfully.  You cringe to hear the words spoken to and about you, in front of all these other buxom beauties.  &quot;I&#39;m the only girl on this level without a belt.  I&#39;m head-bitch for the &lt;&lt;print $girl_last&gt;&gt; floor and you better get used to it.  If you&#39;re real good maybe a Manager will take that belt off of you this month for a quick play...but don&#39;t count on it.&quot;

Tears fill your eyes, even as you lift your hips, your fingers clawing at the belt.  You feel like a dog in heat, your ass up begging to be taken.  You can&#39;t even stop yourself.  You need release, and with no release from the front your body is demanding it from the back...from Lynda... from Lynda&#39;s hard and very wet cock.

You close your eyes and say the word one more time...

&quot;...please...&quot;

You feel it slide up your leg and you arch your back.  Your whole body is in a sensual prison, caught in a feminine trap of satin and lace.  Your mind can&#39;t focus on any one thing... you&#39;re trapped in this place, a toy for the Managers... a toy for Lynda... even a toy for Jasmine.  You&#39;re the bottom of the totem pole... 

It slowly enters, wet and slimy from Jasmine&#39;s mouth.  It hurts and yet your body doesn&#39;t care.  You push against it... begging for some sort of sexual release.  Demanding release.  A loud moan fills the room and you&#39;re horrified to realize that it came from you.  You hear Lynda laugh from behind you...cheering from the onlookers and then as it slides all the way in an explosion as your body convulses with pleasure.  Wave after wave fills you... your trapped organ pulsing over and over, never growing, never fully releasing.  You scream in pleasure as Lynda begins to thrust.  It causes the orgasm to increase.  You&#39;ve never felt one like this... so long and crashing over and over.  Your body locks up.  You can&#39;t take this much pleasure all at once.  All that pent up sexual energy exploding internally and still not coming out.  You scream again, begging for Lynda to stop.  She doesn&#39;t and the orgasm continues... longer... harder... each stroke into you more intense and overwhelming.  The waves of pleasure crash around her hard cock.  You tense, feeling it swell and with a loud grunt, her hands tighten on your hips and she explodes as well.  You can&#39;t breathe.  The pleasure still won&#39;t stop, even as you feel her stickiness inside of you.

Without warning she pulls out, her seed draining from her absence and you gasp in horror.

You just came.  You just came like a girl.  Like a girl in heat, unable to stop yourself.  Lynda just fucked you, came in you... and you came.

But the horror is worse than that... you&#39;re still horny.  You came without release.  You want more.  You need more.  The belt, the clothes, the conditioning... has made you an eager slut... You close your eyes as reality descends upon you.  Cum oozes out of you and you clutch again at your very wet crotch.  You feel Jasmine&#39;s arm around you, pulling you up onto the bed with her.  You belong to her.  You belong to Lynda.  You belong to this new place.  Your name is &lt;&lt;print $name_girl + &quot; &quot; + $girl_last&gt;&gt;.  You belong.

&quot;Get off me!&quot;

Just lay still, it&#39;ll be over soon...

This can&#39;t be happening.  You squirm under her weight, trying to get loose.  You feel hands on your hips and you squirm harder.  A claustrophobic feeling of hysteria descends on you.  The belt, the lingerie, the locked-on heels, the hands all over your body... you&#39;re trapped in a sensual hell where everything you do sinks you further into it.  This shemale bitch is about to fuck you and you can&#39;t seem to get away.  You thrash with all your might, but other girls have come over to help hold you to the bed.  You thrash and cry and shout.  It does no good.  You feel your ass being lifted up and you squirm away, even as your panties are ripped off.  You&#39;re about to be raped, and you know for an absolute fact that this will not be the only time.  This is just the beginning.

You manage to twist and squirm until you&#39;re on your back.  You feel your arms grabbed and pushed to the bed, your legs spread apart.

&quot;Look girls, our little virgin prefers Missionary, just like a little lady.&quot;

You beg and plead as your legs are lifted up onto Lynda&#39;s shoulders.  Your whole body is pinned to the bed, writhing against smooth skin and satin.

Tears fill your eyes because despite the helplessness, and the overwhelming horror of being violated, You STILL feel like a dog in heat.  You need release, and with no release from the front your body is demanding it from the back...from Lynda... from Lynda&#39;s hard and very wet cock that is zeroing in on you.

You close your eyes and say the word one more time...

&quot;...please...&quot;

You close your eyes as reality descends upon you.  Cum oozes out of you and you clutch at your very wet crotch.  Lynda laughs, a low throaty sound. &quot;Alright Jaz, she&#39;s all yours.&quot;

As the onlookers wander away losing interest, Jasmine&#39;s lithe frame crawls between your still spread legs.  She wraps her arms around you.

&quot;Don&#39;t cry baby,&quot; she says kissing your lips, &quot;You&#39;ll get used to it.  It just takes time.  I&#39;ll help you.  Who knows... maybe someday one of us will get to be like Lynda.&quot;

Her smooth body mingles with yours and all of the strength is drawn out of you.  All you can think about is your poor trapped cock and the ever-present horniness that won&#39;t go away.  Jasmine&#39;s mouth covers yours, devouring you...using you.  She grinds against you craving the same stimulation you so desperately desire.  You are unable to stop rubbing against her, even as the lights go out.  All around you, other couples moan and squirm.  There is no release.  There is no escape.

You blush uncontrollably, knowing that each and every eye of this small huddled group of girls is now staring at you.  Staring at you in your little &lt;&lt;print $nightie&gt;&gt; outfit.  Each girl in the group is a pinup wetdream.  Worse so are you!

&quot;Hi, I&#39;m...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re the new &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.  We KNOW!&quot;  The blonde&#39;s voice drips with condescension. &quot;Is it just me or could this one skip the bimbo training?&quot; 

The other girls giggle, turning their backs to you and going back to their huddled whispering.  Anger boils up in you and tears well uncontrollably in your eyes.  You blink them back, even angrier at yourself at the wetness creeping down your cheeks.  You&#39;re even behaving like a girl now.  What has this place done to you.

You turn to go find a bed, feeling very out of place, every step an uncertainty.  Your heart is beating so hard that it must be trying to escape your chest.  Claustrophobia has kicked in, along with fear and anger and that never-ending arousal that just won&#39;t go away.  Your hand snakes down between your legs and you pry at the belt, tears free flowing now.  You need it off.  If you could just get control of this horniness maybe you could think clearly enough to figure out a way out of this infernal hell.  Your fingers find the tiny hole that allows you to pee, and you desperately try to stimulate yourself through it.  No luck.  You pull and pry and twist and nothing moves.  Nothing but a pitiful throb from within it that coats your hands with slime.  You cry harder, sinking to your knees.  The stockings and robe caress as you go, aggravating the problem.  You&#39;re in a sensual prison of torture where every move makes it worse.

The hand on your shoulder makes a soft cry escape through your slick &lt;&lt;print $nail_color&gt;&gt; lips.

&quot;Don&#39;t cry, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;,&quot;.  A dark-skinned Goddess stands above you, offering her hand to help you stand up.  You clasp it and stagger awkwardly to your feet, barely able to make your legs work in the horrid heels.

&quot;See girls,&quot; your new friend says sweetly, &quot;She wants to escape too.  You won&#39;t spoil our plans will you sweetie?&quot;  She turns to you, bringing you into the small, huddled group.  They all look at you suspiciously.

&quot;Don&#39;t tell this new cunt a thing!&quot; The blonde spits the words with venom.  You?  A cunt?  After a whole day of being called one degrading thing after another, hearing this word used on you by this obvious slut rips a giant hole in your heart. &quot;For all you know she&#39;s a spy!&quot;

The others all giggle.  You blush, knowing that you look about as intimidating as a pretty field of flowers.

&quot;Bridget!  Be nice!&quot;

The words are barked hard and demanding from your new friend.  She puts a comforting arm around you.  &quot;This is &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;&#39;s first day.  You remember YOUR first day don&#39;t you?&quot;

Tears start to well again, this time from gratitude that at least you&#39;re not alone...at least you have someone sticking up for you for the first time today.

&quot;We&#39;re planning our escape tonight, &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;!  Are you in?&quot;  Your new friend smiles warmly at you, and you nod.  Anything to get out of this horrible place.  Despite the glaring of Bridget, you&#39;re brought into the huddle.

&quot;Here&#39;s the plan.  There&#39;s a new investing couple staying in the suites tonight.  Mr. Manning said he&#39;ll be checking in down here.  Bridget and Tanya will swipe one of their keycards, and then we&#39;ll take the service elevators up to the basement.  From their we can use the maintanence tunnels which lead to the park and we&#39;ll be out of this crazy place.  I know a guy... who&#39;ll get us out of these belts and then we&#39;re free!&quot;

Hope fills your chest.  Thank God you get to be a part of this.  You&#39;ve got to get out!

&quot;What do I need to do?&quot;  Your voice is a timid whisper.

&quot;You...&quot; your new mentor says solemnly, &quot;You are going to be the distraction.&quot;

&quot;A slut?&quot; the condescending blonde laughs, &quot;Tell that to the big wet spot on the front of your nightie.&quot;  The girls all giggle as you look down horrified.  Your arousal has led to a huge wet stain on the front of your outfit.  You gasp, covering it with your hands.  You blush uncontrollably again, knowing that your current position  makes you look all the more like a pinup model caught in a compromising position.

&quot;...wait...&quot;, but your words are lost in the hubbub.  You&#39;re ushered over to the elevator by several sets of hands just in time to see the doors slowly slide open.  Inside are two people, one male, one female.  Both are dressed impecabbly, although the woman seems to be somewhat on the tarty side with her short skirt and obvious breast implants.  The man&#39;s eyes glimmer as he sees the feast of femininity standing in front of him.  You shudder knowing you&#39;re part of this feast.

&quot;I was told to ask for Lynda.&quot; His voice cuts through the silent thrall of girls standing in a huddle around the door.  Your eyes dart back and forth and then widen as your new friend steps forward.

&quot;I&#39;m Lynda.  I understand you need a Toy for the night.&quot;

The man smiles like a wolf and nods.  The woman to his right looks at him for a second and then drops her eyes, her cheeks turning a vibrant red.

Lynda leans over to you and whispers softly in your ear.  &quot;Seduce him and we&#39;ll try to get the keycard.&quot;

Your eyes bulge out of your head.  What!?!  You stare into the elevator and suddenly realize that all the other girls have stepped back away from Lynda and yourself.

&quot;This is &lt;&lt;print $name_girl&gt;&gt;.&quot;  Lynda drags you forward toward the elevator door.  &quot;See if she&#39;s to your liking.&quot;

THIS is the plan!?!  You have to flirt with this couple to distract them?  Your legs grow weak and you nibble on your lower lip unsure what exactly to do.


[[Flirt with him.|c5_flirtwithhim]]

How may I make your day better?&quot; You say the expected greeting automatically, blinking a little too much which just flutters your long eyelashes.  Lynda nudges you forward and you stagger into the elevator practically falling into his arms.  He catches you with ease, but doesn&#39;t let go.  You look up at him, helplessly.  Nothing for it.  Time to turn on the charm and maybe, just maybe, they&#39;ll get his keycard and you&#39;ll get out of this crazy place.

&quot;Oooh thank you sir.&quot; You try to purr it at him, giving him what you can only hope is a sexy pout. &quot;I&#39;m such a klutz and these heels are soooo high.&quot;

You give him a little giggle, and inside a part of you dies.  Why are you doing this?  How have they turned you into this stupid flirting bimbo so easily?

&quot;What can I do to thank you for catching me?&quot; You gasp at your own forwardness even as the words leave your lips.  It&#39;s a good show.  Now if you can just disentangle yourself from him.  Surely that was enough time.  What more could they possibly expect from you?

&quot;This one will do fine, Lynda.  Thank you.&quot;

What!?!

You squirm in his grip to turn toward Lynda your face a panic.  She smiles at you.  It is not a nice smile.

&quot;Enjoy her, sir.  You&#39;re quite lucky.  She&#39;s a virgin.&quot;

You whimper and then sob.  What is going on?  What happened to the plan?

You squirm out of his grip and take a step out of the elevator toward Lynda who still smiles at you like a cat at a canary.

&quot;The plan...&quot; you hiss at her desperately.

She leans forward and kisses your cheek, whispering seductively into your ear.

&quot;There is no plan, you stupid slut.  There is no escape.  Someone had to go with this asshole tonight and you won the lottery.  Do what he says and maybe you won&#39;t get ripped in two.  I hear he&#39;s huge...

With a soft shove she sends you careening back into the elevator.  He catches you again, even as the doors begin to slide shut.

&quot;...no...&quot; the words drift past your lips even as the evil, grinning faces of all of the other girls disappear behind the doors.

How may I make your day better?&quot; You say the expected greeting automatically, blinking a little too much which flutters your long eyelashes.  Lynda nudges you forward and you stagger into the elevator practically falling into the woman.  She gasps as you collide and the two of you fall into the corner of the elevator car together against the wall.  The man laughs.

&quot;Look darling, she&#39;s already hot for you.&quot;

You feel the woman shudder against you.  She seems to be just as much of a victim in this as you are. You feel him press up against the two of you, a hand grabbing your ass.  You squeal and try to get away, but you&#39;re caught between the two of them. Nothing for it.  Time to turn on the charm and maybe, just maybe, they&#39;ll get his keycard and you&#39;ll get out of this crazy place.

&quot;Oooh thank you sir.&quot; You try to purr it at him, giving him what you can only hope is a sexy pout. You give him a little giggle, and inside a part of you dies.  Why are you doing this?  How have they turned you into this stupid flirting bimbo so easily?

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for being so clumsy.  What can I do to make it up to the two of you?&quot; You gasp at your own forwardness even as the words leave your lips.  It&#39;s a good show.  Now if you can just disentangle yourself from them.  Surely that was enough time.  What more could they possibly expect from you?

&quot;This one will do fine, Lynda.  Thank you.&quot;

What!?!

You squirm in the man&#39;s grip, pressing against the woman who squirms as well.   You manage to turn toward Lynda, your face a panic.  She smiles at you.  It is not a nice smile.

&quot;Enjoy her, sir.  You&#39;re quite lucky.  She&#39;s a virgin.&quot;

You whimper.  What is going on?  What happened to the plan?

&quot;There is no plan, you stupid slut.  There is no escape.  Someone had to go with this asshole and his reluctant slut of a wife tonight and you won the lottery.  Do what he says and maybe you&#39;ll just have to play with her and SHE can get him off.  I hear he&#39;s huge...

With a soft shove she sends you careening back into the elevator.  He catches you again, even as the doors begin to slide shut.

&quot;...no...&quot; the words drift past your lips even as the evil, grinning faces of all of the other girls disappear behind the doors.


[[Click here to continue.|c5_roomservice]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="304" name="c5_roomservice" tags="" position="475,3850">You are dragged through a labyrinthian maze of corridors, elevators and reception rooms.  He has you by the wrist as if you were a small child, the horrid heels making you prance along behind him taking thousands of steps to his very few.  Your heels click loudly in your ears as you scurry after him, and you find yourself envying the sandles that the woman walking alongside you wears.  The trip is a whirlwind blur, never an opportunity for escape.  Not that your mind is capable of much rational thought.  How did you end up in this position?

Your eyes keep finding his hand gripped around your wrist.  Your arm looks so small and feminine in his grasp, the body connected to it can&#39;t possibly be yours.

Then with a swipe of a key and a flurry of movement you find yourself at the final destination.  Your hand goes to your mouth to cover the whimper that escapes.

You&#39;re in what can only be a hotel suite...

&quot;Go change darling.  You know what I want you to wear.&quot;

For a moment you think he&#39;s talking to you.  Then you see the other woman reluctantly set off for the bathroom.  You turn and look at the man, your eyes wide and horror-filled, even as he wraps an arm around your waist, pulling you into the center of the room.  Finally, you resist.

&quot;Please... no... you have to help me get out of here...&quot;

His laugh rings in your ears and takes most of the fight out of you.

&quot;You really are new aren&#39;t you?&quot; He smacks your ass and you jump with surprise. &quot;Another word and you&#39;re not going to sit down for a week bitch.  You&#39;re not here to talk...&quot;  His hands are all over you.  You try to push them away, but there seems to be just too many exposed places on your body for him to take advantage of.

&quot;Get on the bed...&quot;

His words aren&#39;t a request.  He leans into you, practically throwing you onto the large King-sized bed and you scramble toward the head of it away from him. From this new vantage point a horrible view is now available.  There is a large, and very distinct bulge in the front of his pants.  You close your eyes in fear and horror.  You don&#39;t know what to do.  You&#39;ve never felt more trapped and helpless.  Your smooth legs are curled underneath you.  The satin robe has ridden up.  There is no modesty.  You know you look like a virgin pinup girl, all dressed up for his pleasure.  You open your eyes and see him taking you in.  He is practically drooling at the sight of you.

&quot;Get your ass out here, woman!&quot;

He barely has time to finish before the bathroom door opens.  The woman has reappeared, wearing next to nothing.  Her outfit is still less revealing than yours, her babydoll teddy going further down her legs, her bra very visible underneath it.  Her eyes have a resignation in them that you recognize.

&quot;Get on the bed with her.&quot;

The woman slowly moves to the bed.  Your eyes dart down to her hand.  It is shaking.  The woman is scared too.  Why is he doing this to the two of you?

She sits on the bed, as far away from you as possible, her body stiff.

&quot;Now...&quot; his voice is a low, gutteral sound, &quot;...give each other a kiss hello.&quot;


[[Kiss her.|c5_kissher]]
[[Refuse to kiss her.|c5_dontkiss]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="305" name="c5_kissher" tags="" position="600,3850">You lean toward the woman.  Better her than him, after all.  She doesn&#39;t meet you halfway.  She sits there, stiff as a board.  You have to crawl over to her, across the giant bed and then you awkwardly plant a kiss on her cheek.

&quot;Kiss her Margerie...&quot; his voice is stone and her eyes blink back tears.  She turns to you and slowly presses her lips to yours.  For a long moment you both sit there, lips pressed together.  You&#39;re unsure what to do.  You can tell she doesn&#39;t want to be kissed, her lips are pinched together so tightly.  You start to pull away, but her hands grab your nightie, holding you there.  She&#39;s not going to let you go, so you stay right there, locked in an awkward kiss.

&quot;...mouth open...&quot; you can barely hear him, his voice is so low.  You know why.  He&#39;s forcing the two of you to put on a sapphic show for him.  You can only imagine how it must look, the two of you together...the power he must feel.  Her mouth opens, moving yours open as well.  Her tongue stays hidden in her mouth, as does yours.  Neither of you daring to go further.

&quot;Get closer...&quot;

You both squish together.  You feel her smooth skin, cool against your own.  Her arms wrap around you, and not knowing what to do with yours, you put them around her.  Your locked equipment screams with pleasure and pain as it attempts to expand rapidly with no where to go.  You whimper and squirm in discomfort, writhing against her which makes it worse.  Your body is overwhelmed with carnal need that can not be fulfilled and just the touch of her hands has intensified the arousal a thousand-fold.  You feel her breasts against your pushed up chest.  Her knee slides up between your legs and you press against it, sliding up and down.  You can&#39;t help yourself, the arousal is overwhelming and you slowly grind against her leg.  Her hands are not eager, but they slowly caress your body putting on a show for the man at the foot of the bed.  Your own hands trace her curves and as they find the curve of her back, her tongue drifts into your mouth.

Your brain hits sensory overload and you shudder with what is almost an orgasm.  It is so intense, you lose track of all sense of time and space.  Only the slightly movement on the bed brings conscious thought back.  You feel her tense in your arms.

HE has joined the two of you on the bed.

This pervert fucker wants you to put on a sapphic show with his wife just so he can sit and watch.  You know what you look like, how they&#39;ve made you look at this horrible place... and you know just how sexy it would look to have the two of you going at it like dogs in heat.  There is a hatred of this, of you, in her eyes and you try to silently apologize to her.  This certainly isn&#39;t YOUR idea.  How did you end up in this situation?

She nibbles on her lip, her eyes drifting to the side to look at him.  Her face melts with resignation and she turns to look back at you.  This time her eyes apologize to you even as you feel his hand on the back of your head.  You flinch away, but he grabs hold of your hair and pushes you forward.  His hand is on her neck too, and ever so slowly he forces your faces together.

Your lips touch.  Neither of you move.  You feel her trembling against you.  Never in a million years would you have imagined yourself in this situation. 

&quot;Very good.&quot;

His voice is low and full of lust.  The two of you must make quite the picture.  Two pretty girls, lips pressed together... forced to do his every whim.

&quot;Now kiss...&quot;

You feel a squeeze on your neck and you know what he wants.  You shake your head refusing to give him what he asks.  He squeezes harder.  You pinch your lips together in refusal.  You&#39;re not going to make this girl kiss you if she doesn&#39;t want to.

Then without warning her mouth opens.  Your lips are surrounded by her soft, wet mouth and without meaning to, your mouth opens as well.  You feel his hand on your neck, keeping the two of you pressed together.  He got his way and it fills you with disgust, even as her tongue snakes into your mouth.  You accept it, knowing she&#39;s being forced into this as well.

Between your legs, your trapped member painfully throbs and leaks.  You squirm.  She does as well and it dawns on you that you&#39;re both unwillingly getting turned on by this forced display.

You both squish together.  You feel her smooth skin, cool against your own.  Her arms wrap around you, and not knowing what to do with yours, you put them around her.

You try to scream, but the sound goes into her, a useless muffled sound that resembles a moan far too much.  Then you feel it, sliding between the two of you.  The hot, throbbing thing pushes past both of your lips and you find yourself kissing both her AND him.  Your eyes widen in horror!  This can&#39;t be happening!  You feel her tongue snaking underneath his cock and touching your lower lip.  You turn your head away and it follows, as does she.  You try to shut your lips, but the damnable lipstick on your mouth makes them too wet and slippery to stay closed.  He squeezes your neck hard and you gasp, your mouth opening even wider.  Your lips are now back against hers, only now both of you have an obstacles between your tongues.  He moans in pleasure and you whimper again as it slowly moves forward and backward molesting both you and his wife at the same time.  It grows larger and you know how this is going to end.  You close your eyes waiting for the horror to be over.  But in the darkness, as you&#39;re used for both his AND her pleasure, you know that the horrors have only just begun.

Suddenly, the cock is gone and you&#39;re only kissing her again.   His words cut through your silent relief.

&quot;On your back slut!&quot;

For a moment, you don&#39;t know if he&#39;s talking to you or her.  You open your eyes and realize that you&#39;re the slut.  Not her.  Not him.  You.

Reluctantly you lean back onto the bed.  You can&#39;t stop trembling.  You&#39;re the other girl in a threesome...a threesome that you&#39;re being forced to endure with no choice or say in anything.  You bite your lip even as the next words leave his mouth.

&quot;Panties off darling.  Let&#39;s see if the slut is as good with the ladies.&quot;  Your eyes are wide as the woman slowly strip the flimsy panties down her legs and discards them.  You lay there helplessly as he maneuvers her up onto you, her legs straddling your head.  You brace yourself as she descends, her unprotected sex pressing against your face.  Inside your belt, pain erupts and you squirm helplessly.  You lick and suck unable to help yourself.  The arousal is so great, and so unfulfilled that you are unable to think of anything except sex and lust and carnal desire.

As she leans forward, her head between your legs...her hair tickling your thighs, you want to scream.  She can&#39;t reciprocate.  She can&#39;t please you.  You are only for the pleasure of others.  She nibbles at your thigh, and you moan uncontrollably.  Then something joins your eager tongue, plunging into her.  HE has entered the picture again.  You close your eyes, even as you feel his balls slide against your face as he fucks her on top of your mouth.  You can&#39;t stop licking.  Your body is an out of control sexual beast and despite your disgust at the deplorable situation you find yourself in, you continue... licking her...licking him.  You know how it&#39;s going to end and as they both erupt into an orgasm that is denied to you, your face splattered in their combined juices, a realization sinks in. No matter how hard you resist, no matter what you do or say, the horrors have only just begun.

&quot;On your back darling!&quot;

For a moment, you don&#39;t know if he&#39;s talking to you or her.  Then without any hesitation at all, his wife lays back on the bed.  Her legs drift open and you find yourself kneeling in a very provoctive pose above her. You look at him wide-eyed.  He wants you to...

&quot;Take off her panties slut.&quot;

There is no doubt that he&#39;s talking to you this time.  You look up at her and the resignation is gone.  Her eyes are closed, her back is arched, her breathing heavy.  She&#39;s turned on.

You nibble your lower lip as you slowly pull her panties down her smooth legs, forcing them together.  As they slide off her ankles, her legs spring open again showing you everything.  Inside your belt, your member aches.  You can smell her scent.  It mingles with your own.

...and his...

&quot;Get on all fours, slut.&quot;

His hand pushes you forward and you find your face between her thighs.  He pushes you again and suddenly your face is buried in her crotch.  Her hands grab your head and you know there&#39;s nothing for it now.  You slowly begin to kiss... and then lick.  Her thighs clamp around your head.  She begins to moan and for a moment your passion takes over.  You try to please her, licking and nibbling and kissing and sucking.

The realization that something is wrong takes a moment to kick in.  It&#39;s only as you feel the tug on your own panties that you realize his hand has been rubbing your ass.  You try to scream, but again there is nowhere for the sound to go but into her.  The panties don&#39;t resist.  Your ass is up and exposed and you hear them rip as he yanks them down.  You try to squirm away, but her hands and her thighs keep you pinned,even as he lifts your ass up into the air.  You feel it against your smooth skin...the hot, throbbing, wet thing that had been in your mouth only minutes ago.  You try to get away, but they both prevent it easily.  You whimper as it presses against your backside and as it finds it&#39;s mark you scream again.  It does no good.

As it begins to slide inside of you, a realization overwhelms you.

This is your life now.  There isn&#39;t going to be an escape... there&#39;s no going BACK from this.  You&#39;ve been turned into a sex-toy in the course of a single day.  As he pushes all the way into you, your trapped member finally gives up and explodes in a pleasureless burst of liquid.  You moan helplessly as he continues to fuck you, your mouth trapped on the writhing figure beneath you.

The pain begins to mingle with an unwanted pleasure and as a second pleasureless orgasm overwhelms you, you close your eyes.  This is your future and as both of them cum around you, a realization sinks in that no matter how hard you resist, the horrors have only just begun.
